                                                                              Lautenberg Responds to Kentucky Airline Crash

                                                                              Senator Calls for Hearings into Staffing Crisis Facing Nation s Air Traffic Controllers   Contact  Alex Formuzis  202  224 7340 Friday  September 1  2006      NEWARK  N J    In the aftermath of Sunday s  Comair crash at Lexington  s Blue Grass Airport  United States Senator Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ  called for Congressional hearings into the staffing crisis among the nation  s air traffic controllers   Approximately 70 percent of the current workforce will be eligible for retirement by 2011  and there are already 1 081 fewer controllers throughout the U S  now than there were three years ago       In a letter to the Chairman of the Commerce Committee  s Aviation Subcommittee Lautenberg expressed concerns over the number of air traffic controllers currently manning the control towers at airports throughout the country         In light of the serious safety implications that may affect multiple control towers throughout the U S  air traffic control system  I request a hearing to determine the risks to the traveling public   My personal belief is that the FAA must move swiftly to hire many new air traffic controllers     wrote Lautenberg in his letter to Senator Conrad Burns  R MT     Chairman of the Subcommittee        While the facts surrounding last Sunday  s crash are still emerging  reports indicate that only one air traffic controller was working at the time of the crash   The Federal Aviation Administration  s  FAA  own policy requires that at least two controllers should be in the tower at all times  Reports are that this particular controller worked a shift from 6 30 a m  to 2 30 p m  on Saturday  August 26  and was required to work again from 11 30 p m  later that evening until 8 00 a m  Sunday morning              A copy of the letter is attached to this release       Friday  September 1st  2006      The Honorable Conrad Burns  Chairman  Subcommittee on Aviation  Senate Committee on Commerce  Science  and Transportation  427 Hart Senate Office Building  Washington  DC 20510      Dear Chairman Burns       I am writing to request that the Subcommittee on Aviation of the Senate Committee on Commerce  Science  and Transportation hold a hearing as soon as possible on the air traffic controller staffing crisis facing our nation  s airports   I would expect that the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration  FAA   the Honorable Marion Blakey  will testify at this hearing           The recent tragic crash of Comair flight 5191 in Lexington  Kentucky raises serious concerns about the FAA  s staffing of domestic air traffic control towers    While the facts of this case are still emerging  it is clear that only one air traffic controller was working at the time of the crash  contrary to the agency  s own policy   Additionally  this controller worked a shift from 6 30 a m  to 2 30 p m  on Saturday  August 26  and was required to work again from 11 30 p m  later that evening to 8 a m  Sunday morning   As such  the controller may have had limited opportunity to rest between two strenuous  and  full shifts   as it is reported that he only  slept for  2 hours during that break   We await the full results of the investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board  but it appears that the FAA  s failure to adequately staff this tower may have lead to unsafe conditions for aircraft operation             In light of the serious safety implications that may affect multiple control towers throughout the U S  air traffic control system  I request a hearing to determine the risks to the traveling public   My personal belief is that the FAA must move swiftly to hire many new air traffic controllers   70 percent of the current workforce will be eligible for retirement by 2011  and there are already 1 081 fewer controllers throughout the U S  now than there were three years ago   It is well known through prior hearings that it can take  on average  four years to train a new air traffic controller   The FAA issued a comprehensive staffing plan in December of 2004  however  it is my understanding that the agency now anticipates an even greater number of retirements  and has not developed a strategy to hire an equivalent or greater number of new controllers             I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to hear from Administrator Blakey on this important safety issue   Mr  Chairman  thank you for considering my request on this matter         Sincerely        Frank R  Lautenberg                   Questions or Comments

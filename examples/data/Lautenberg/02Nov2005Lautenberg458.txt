                                                                               Wednesday  November 2  2005      Washington  D C     Following a Bush Administration decision to withdraw funding allocated to the state of New Jersey to provide counseling services for 9 11 victims and their families  U S  Senators Jon S  Corzine  D NJ  and Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ   joined by a bipartisan group of New Jersey members of Congress  today called on the administration to restore those funds  which have helped tens of thousands of New Jerseyans in the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks        The State of New Jersey lost almost 700 citizens in the September 11 terrorist attacks  In April of 2002  the Justice Department used funds appropriated by Congress to issue a grant to New Jersey for aid and support to first responders  victims  and their families  The state of New Jersey used that grant  worth  8 5 million  for several counseling initiatives  including 24 hour hotlines for first responders and other victims  free mental health services  community education  and group intervention services  More than 54 000 individuals were reached through community outreach programs  and more than 3 000 received individual or group counseling       The statute appropriating the funds for victims states that the money would remain available until expended  New Jersey had yet to spend over  1 4 million from the grant when the funding was withdrawn       In a letter to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales  the senators  joined by U S  Representatives Robert Menendez  D 13th Dist    Scott Garrett  R 5th Dist    Rush Holt  D 12th Dist    Frank Pallone Jr   D 6th Dist    Donald Payne  D 10th Dist    Steve Rothman  D 9th Dist    Bill Pascrell  D 8th Dist   and Robert Andrews  D 1st Dist    asked that the Victims Assistance Counseling Grant provided through the Justice Department be restored in light of the success of the program and its continued importance to victims and their families  The text of the letter is reprinted below       Dear Attorney General Gonzales       We are extremely distressed that the Office for Victims of Crime   OVC   issued a decision on October 31  2005  rejecting an appeal of its decision to terminate funding to New Jersey under the FY02 Victim Assistance Counseling Grant for Victims of 9 11 Attacks on America program        As we explained in our first letter to you  the funding provided by OVC has allowed the New Jersey Attorney General s Office to create a program that provides a 24 hour hotline for first responders and other victims of the attacks  mental health counseling within a statewide network of mental health professionals  community education  and therapeutic group intervention  This is a hugely successful program that has provided needed and urgent care to thousands of victims of the September 11 attacks  including the family members of those killed in the attacks and the first responders who gave so selflessly of their time and energy and now need our help        To date  the State of New Jersey has used some  but not all  of the federal funds allocated pursuant to the grant  There remains a strong and continuing need for assistance  almost four thousand first responders have sought assistance from the program in the last several months  Further  the statute and conference report appropriating the funds state that the money shall  remain available until expended   and OVC referenced this language in its conversations with New Jersey  New Jersey made commitments and promises to its citizens based on this language  and it is unfair and harmful to the victims of September 11 to terminate the program now        We therefore once again urgently request that you immediately reverse the decision to terminate funding  We believe that the Department of Justice must honor its commitment to the victims of September 11 by permitting the remainder of the allocated funds to be provided to the State of New Jersey                         Questions or Comments

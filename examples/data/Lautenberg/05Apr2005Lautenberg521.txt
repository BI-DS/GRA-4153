     Senator Frank R  Lautenberg                                                                                                                      Press Release        of        Senator Lautenberg                                                                                Senator Lautenberg s Statement During a Senate Hearing on the Implementation of New Medicare Law                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Tuesday  April 5  2005      It has been almost a year and a half since Congress passed and President Bush signed  the law that will make profound changes in the Medicare program       We have since learned that the information given to Congress during the debate on the bill was false  The cost was understated by hundreds of millions of dollars       Unfortunately  the deception didn t end there  Since the bill was passed  the Administration has engaged in illegal propaganda in an attempt to  spin  this bill to the American people       They did this by producing  video news releases  which were distributed to local television stations  for use in their news programs        To someone who saw these videos on their local station  they might appear to be news       In fact  they featured a fake news reporter    paid by the government and reading a script prepared by the government        That isn t news    it s government propaganda  But viewers who were exposed to this material on TV stations around the country had no way of knowing that       These videos were produced with money from the Medicare Trust Fund  Three propaganda releases were produced    two in English and one in Spanish       In one script  the Administration suggests that local news anchors lead into the video by saying   Reporter Karen Ryan helps sort through the details        But Karen Ryan wasn t working for a news organization that was part of our free press  She was working for the government    and getting paid to say what they wanted her to say       Again  that isn t news    it s propaganda       On May 19  2004  the Government Accountability Office issued a legal opinion that HHS and CMS had violated the law by using taxpayer dollars to fund  covert propaganda        I asked the GAO to investigate this matter further  to determine exactly where the Administration had crossed the line between legitimate information and political propaganda       It s wrong to try to pull the wool over the American peoples  eyes    and if you try to do it with their own money  it s illegal       But that wasn t the end of the matter  Basically  HHS and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services thumbed its nose at the law       It s bad enough that the Administration crossed the line between information and propaganda  But it s even worse to ignore a legal opinion from the Government Accountability Office       When you do that  you are telling the American people   We are not accountable        Its wrong Mr  Chairman  and I am hopeful Dr  McClellan will address this issue                        Questions or Comments

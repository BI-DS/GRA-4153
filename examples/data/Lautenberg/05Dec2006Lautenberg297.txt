                                                                               Contact  Alex Formuzis  202  224 7340 Tuesday  December 5  2006          WASHINGTON    U S  Senators Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ   Robert Menendez  D NJ  Charles Schumer  D NY  and Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY   today released their respective holds on the Ryan White CARE Act  following vigorous negotiations with both Republican and Democratic colleagues that will save New Jersey and New York from millions in proposed cuts  The final version of the Act reauthorization still includes a one time reduction in overall funding for New York and New Jersey  but eliminates the tens of millions more in proposed cuts that would decimate the ability of New York and New Jersey to serve people living with HIV and AIDS          The Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency  CARE  Act is the federal law that addresses the unmet health needs of persons living with HIV disease by funding primary health care and support services that enhance access to care          Earlier versions of this year  s reauthorization threatened drastic cuts of over  100 million for both New Jersey and New York   a prospect unacceptable to lawmakers from both the Garden State and the Empire State  These cuts would have limited access to critical services for people living with HIV and AIDS  such as primary health care  support services  and medication assistance programs  The four senators placed a hold on the reauthorization bill  using a parliamentary privilege afforded to U S  Senators that prevented the bill  s consideration by the full Senate  Their holds were released today           Over the past year  I have been working with my colleagues to reauthorize this important piece of legislation and have been forced time and time again to oppose reauthorization proposals because of their devastating impact on New York  the epicenter of the HIV AIDS epidemic   I am proud that we have forged a three year compromise that contains essential protections for New York and other hard hit states   We have come a long way from the original proposals to decimate and devastate our systems of care in New York and other parts of the country   However  much work needs to be done going forward   This bill alone cannot make up for years of flat funding for programs that provide essential care and support services across the nation   I look forward to working with my colleagues over the coming years to improve the ability of this act to meet the needs of all people living with HIV and AIDS     said Senator Clinton           Every man  woman and child living with HIV AIDS deserves the best treatment we can give them  and that  s what our fight over the distribution of funding has been about   Instead of leaving those New Jerseyans without the care and resources they need  we  ve restored millions in proposed funding cuts     Senator Lautenberg said     I look forward to working closely with Senator Kennedy to make further improvements to the Ryan White law in January              While this final bill is not everything we would have liked to achieve  it is a far cry from where the original proposals began     Senator Menendez said    This compromise bill preserves New Jersey  s Eligible Metropolitan Areas  sets a funding floor for formula grants and holds the Bush administration accountable for how supplemental EMA funds are spent  Moreover  New Jersey lawmakers have elicited commitments from Senator Ted Kennedy that our state will have a seat at the table in ensuring our state  s interests moving forward              We are happy to reach a compromise that staves off millions of dollars in cuts  but realize that work remains to be done     said Senator Schumer     We need to continue to fight for additional money for the Ryan White CARE Act so the funding corresponds to need  and so that New Yorkers living with HIV AIDS receive the care and services they deserve   We also need to re visit the entire structure of the CARE Act to better serve the needs of people living with HIV AIDS in the future             First enacted by Congress in 1990  the Ryan White CARE Act was amended and reauthorized in 1996 and again in 2000  The bill reaches over 500 000 individuals each year  making it the federal government s largest program specifically for people living with HIV and AIDS  The CARE Act was named for Ryan White  an Indiana teenager whose courageous struggle with HIV AIDS and against AIDS related discrimination helped educate the nation

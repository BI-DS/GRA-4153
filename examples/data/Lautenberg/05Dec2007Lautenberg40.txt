safety today released a Government Accountability Office study showing that ground operations at the nations airports have not been improved in more than five years   Sen  Frank R  Lautenberg  N J    a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce  Science  and Transportation joined with Rep  James L  Oberstar  Minn    Chairman of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure  and Rep  Jerry F  Costello  Ill    Chairman of the Subcommittee on Aviation  to release the findings at a Capitol Hill news conference  The three requested the study in June of last year   As passengers fly to visit family and friends this holiday season  they shouldn t have to worry about the safety of their flights  Unfortunately  this report makes clear that the Bush Administration is cutting corners and failing to put passenger safety first  said Sen  Lautenberg  A safe flight begins and ends on a safe runway  but the FAA is taking too many chances and ignoring too many red flags  I plan on introducing legislation to refocus this Administration s priorities to ensure safer runways  safer airports and safer skies   The National Transportation Safety Board has included improving runway safety on its Most Wanted List since the list was established in 1990  While new technologies have come on line and are slowly being deployed to U S  airports  serious runway incursions and other incidents continue to occur  Oberstar said  The GAOs findings are distressing  Despite spending billions on runway safety over the last five years  the GAO found that the Federal Aviation Administrations lack of coordination and leadership  technology challenges  the lack of data  and human factors related issues have seriously hindered significant progress on runway safety   In brief  the GAO study found that    Runway incursions are increasing  and runway overruns and ramp safety are areas of concern  Preliminary data for fiscal year 2007 indicates that the overall runway incursion rate of 6 05 incursions per 1 million air traffic control operations is 12 percent higher than in 2006  and is nearly as high as the fiscal year 2001 peak of 6 1 incursions per 1 million air traffic control operations     The FAAs National Runway Safety Plan is out of date and FAAs runway safety efforts are uncoordinated  The FAAs Office of Runway Safety has not carried out its leadership role  which calls for coordinating and monitoring runway safety activities to ensure that goals are met through its National Runway Safety Plan  which was last released in 2002     Controller fatigue may play a role in runway safety  Air traffic controllers at some of the nations busiest airports are working 6 day weeks due to staffing shortages    Cost increases and delays have plagued deployment of runway safety technology  The Airport Surface Detection Equipment  Model X  ASDE X   runway safety technology that is designed to alert air traffic controllers of potential collisions  has faced cost increases and schedule delays  and has experienced problems with its alerting function     Data is unreliable  FAA lacks reliable runway and ramp safety data and the mechanisms to ensure that the data is complete   The GAO has recommended that the FAA take several steps to enhance runway and ramp safety  including preparing a new National Runway Safety Plan  establishing a non punitive voluntary safety reporting program for air traffic controllers  and increasing data collection and analysis    Based on this report  Sen  Lautenberg plans to expand his original 2005 runway safety law to address the GAOs new findings    After a jet overran the runway at Teterboro Airport in February 2005  crossing a busy rush hour highway and injuring 13 people as it crashed into a warehouse  Sen  Lautenberg offered an amendment to the FY 2006 Transportation Appropriations bill to require all major U S  airports to comply with FAAs standard for runway safety areas by 2015  The Senators provision became law on November 30  2005                         Questions or Comments

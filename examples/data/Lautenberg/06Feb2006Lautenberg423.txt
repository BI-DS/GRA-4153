     Senator Frank R  Lautenberg                                                                                                                      Press Release        of        Senator Lautenberg                                                                                New Jersey Senators Take ATF Chief to Task for Spending Millions In Elaborate Spending on Office Furniture While He Considers Cutting 500 Bullet Proof Vests                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Monday  February 6  2006      WASHINGTON    U S  Senators Robert Menendez and Frank R  Lautenberg today called for Senate Judiciary Committee hearings to investigate reports of proposed exorbitant expenditures at the Bureau of Alcohol  Tobacco and Firearms  including a  65 000 conference table and  100 000 hardwood flooring  The senators also questioned the Bush Administration s commitment to enforcing America s gun trafficking laws  citing the overwhelming incidence of out of state guns used in New Jersey crimes       In a letter to Carl Truscott  ATF director  the New Jersey senators questioned the need for expensive office upgrades while laws governing firearms are not adequately enforced and equipment for field agents is under the knife          These  unnecessary upgrades  including nearly  300 000 in upgrades for your office suite alone  ha ve  put this project  19 million over budget  just as the ATF is eliminating funding for 500 bulletproof vests and 300 new cars for field agents who enforce the nation s federal gun laws   the letter said       A recent press report outlined extensive upgrades proposed by Director Truscott for the ATF s Washington headquarters including such costly items as a  65 000 conference table  and  100 000 for hardwood floors  This while the ATF has lagged in enforcing gun trafficking laws and prosecuted only 7 cases of illegal gun trafficking between 1999 and 2001 in New Jersey  Over 70 percent of guns used in New Jersey crimes can be traced to other states    meaning the Garden State is the unfortunate beneficiary of under enforced trafficking laws        This decision to put luxury office suites ahead of critical law enforcement equipment is deeply troubling and is a reminder that this administration is not committed to enforcing the gun laws on the books   the senators said       Menendez and Lautenberg plan to forward their request for hearings to Judiciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter  R PA  and ranking member Patrick Leahy  D VT         Below is the letter sent to Director Truscott       February 6  2006      Carl Truscott  Director      Bureau of Alcohol  Tobacco and Firearms      Washington  DC      Dear Director Truscott       I was dismayed and alarmed to hear reports that ATF law enforcement support critical to New Jersey is being cut to cover cost overruns for a new  luxurious Washington headquarters office building  According to the Justice Department s Inspection General s office  unnecessary upgrades  including nearly  300 000 in upgrades for your office suite alone  has put this project  19 million over budget  just as the ATF is eliminating funding for 500 bulletproof vests and 300 new cars for field agents who enforce the nation s federal gun laws       This decision to put luxury office suites ahead of critical law enforcement equipment is deeply troubling and is a reminder that this administration is not committed to enforcing the gun laws on the books  As you know  New Jersey is inundated with more out of state crime guns than any state in America  According to ATF  between 1999 and 2001  the latest year in which trace data is publicly available   70 5  of the guns traced to crimes committed in New Jersey were originally bought in other states  Nationally  the average is about one third  The southern states of Florida  Georgia  North and South Carolina and Virginia are habitual sources of out of state crime guns  Yet enforcement of existing gun laws designed to prosecute gun traffickers is almost non existent       Between 2000 and 2002  federal prosecutors filed only 7 cases against illegal gun trafficking in New Jersey  1 case against corrupt gun stores  3 cases for possessing a gun with an obliterated serial number  zero cases for possessing a stolen firearm  and zero cases for selling a gun to a minor  These are all cases that relate to how criminals get guns  yet the enforcement of these laws in New Jersey and throughout America is so rare that the laws might as well not exist       The Bush administration came into office promising to enforce the gun laws on the books and instead seems more committed to mahogany paneling and brass doorknobs for the director s suite  I plan on asking for congressional hearings on why critical resources are being diverted from enforcement and why the enforcement of federal gun laws has been so lax       Thank you for your attention to this matter                         Questions or Comments

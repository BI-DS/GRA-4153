                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Monday  February 6  2006      WASHINGTON  DC    United States Senators Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ  and Robert Menendez  D NJ  today declared President Bush s budget proposal for Fiscal Year 2007 a disaster that will shortchange a number of New Jersey s important priorities  The Bush budget proposal will dramatically cut funding for such vital priorities as healthcare  homeland security  education and transportation        Lautenberg served as the Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee from 1997 to 2000 and oversaw the first balanced budget in decades  Senator Menendez is currently a member of the Budget Committee        President Bush has proposed a budget that would slash billions of dollars in health care for New Jersey s seniors  education for our kids and police on our streets   said Lautenberg   The President s budget puts New Jersey and its needs on the chopping block         The president s policies have left our nation in a fiscal crisis  and now he is asking New Jersey s families to pay the price  If this budget passes  our children will have fewer opportunities to get a first class education  our families will live in dirtier and more dangerous communities  and our seniors will pay more for health care   Menendez said   Our state and our nation cannot afford the president s plan  and I hope New Jerseyans of both parties will join Frank Lautenberg and I to fight for a budget that reflects our values        Shortchanging our Seniors      President Bush is again proposing to privatize Social Security  His plan would spend  712 billion to privatize Social Security  which would add  5 trillion to the debt over the first 20 years  risk Social Security benefits in the stock market  and result in benefit cuts of 30 percent or more       The President proposes to cut Medicare by  36 billion over five years  specifically calling for increased monthly premiums for doctors visits  Medicare Part B  for many seniors in New Jersey       The President plans to cut housing funding assistance for seniors by 26 percent and for people with disabilities by 50 percent  In addition  his budget eliminates funding for Alzheimer s disease demonstration grants and preventative health services for seniors  and cuts funding for the National Family Caregiver Support Program and Meals on Wheels       Cuts hospital funding by  20 billion over five years       No Help for the Uninsured      Medicaid and the State Children s Health Insurance Program would be cut by  5 billion nationally over five years       The budget contains no serious attempt to expand access to health insurance for the 1 1 million New Jerseyans without it        Neglecting Transportation      The President wants to slash Amtrak s budget by  400 million  or 30 percent  The President s proposal of  900 million is just half the  1 8 billion Amtrak needs  This is in the face of strong support for Amtrak in Congress  Senator Lautenberg and Lott s bill to fund Amtrak at  11 4 billion over the next six years passed the Senate 93 6 last year       The president has proposed raising the per flight airline security fee by  2 50 for a per flight total of  5  This is a new tax on the 30 million passengers who fly in and out of Newark Airport each year       Enron Accounting Gimmicks Totaling  1 5 Trillion      The Bush budget leaves out  404 billion for the Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  and more than  1 trillion for necessary Minimum Alternative Tax fixes  and large  unspecified cuts beyond 2007       Millions of Children Left Behind      The President s FY07 budget proposes the largest cut to federal education funding in the 26 year history of the Education Department    a  2 1 billion reduction  for a total of  54 410 billion  If enacted  this would be a 3 8 percent cut below the comparable FY06 level of  56 553 billion       The President s budget leaves behind the 70 665 in New Jersey who would be fully served by Title I if the program were funded at the level promised by NCLB  Under the Bush budget New Jersey will receive an estimated  259 8 million in Title I money    a shortfall of  233 9 million under the level authorized by NCLB       Special Education      Under the Bush budget  New Jersey will receive  336 million in special education funding    a shortfall of  192 2 million under the  528 3 million promised by the IDEA Improvement Act of 2004        Limiting Access to College      The average Pell Grant will increase by a meager  18  an insult to the 115 000 New Jersey students facing an 8 percent tuition increase and tuition costs that are nearly  2 700 higher than the national average  The average Pell Grant  which used to cover 80 percent of the average annual cost of tuition  now covers less than half the cost of a four year public college        The Bush budget again proposes eliminating Perkins loans  which benefit more than 14 000 low income students in New Jersey  and provide loan forgiveness Perkins borrowers serving in law enforcement  education  or nursing       Shortchanging America s Communities      The budget cuts Community Development Block Grants for New Jersey by 20 percent  which means the burden will fall on New Jersey property taxpayers to make up a  20 million shortfall       Over one billion dollars have been pumped back into revitalizing New Jersey s neighborhoods through the HOPE VI program  The President has again proposed eliminating this program  which will deprive communities most in need of the chance for revitalization       The budget cuts funding for local police  COPS  by an astounding 79 percent  a  376 million cut from last year  The COPS program has kept New Jersey safe by putting 4 800 more policemen on the streets       Shortchanging our Security      Defying the will of over 70 Senators  President Bush has proposed cutting the Army Guard and Army Reserve personnel strength  After losing 20  of its strength last year  the New Jersey National Guard could now lose an entire battalion        After a  250 million cut last year  the President s budget again cuts Homeland Security grants to states  high threat urban areas  and first responders  The President calls for a cut of  395 million to our nation s first responders  Even worse  President Bush proposes to eliminate grants for the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention program       New Jersey has seen its share of homeland security funds decrease in the past two years  In 2005  New Jersey received  60 8 million from the Homeland Security Grant program  a decrease from the  90 million in 2004  New Jersey s cities have suffered  with Newark seeing a 17  cut and Jersey city seeing a 61  cut last year       Breaking our Promises to Our Troops      The President has again proposed nickel and diming veterans with new fees on their healthcare  His budget calls for a new  250 enrollment fee and nearly doubling drug co pays from  8 to  15 for some veterans based on their income and disability levels  These proposals affect the more than 550 000 veterans in New Jersey       The proposal also imposes new costs on TRICARE beneficiaries  although it does not specify what these costs are  Early indications pointed to as much as tripling enrollment fees and co pays       The President pays lip service to supporting our troops  but refuses to budget for the  387 billion CBO says will be necessary to continue to fight the war in Iraq        The President cuts funding for construction at New Jersey s military bases by  77 million  In Fiscal Year 2006 New Jersey s military bases received  112 5 million in funding for construction  The President s budget calls for only  35 5 million for construction at New Jersey s military bases       Harming New Jersey s Environment      The administration has again refused to propose reinstatement of the  polluter pays  tax on chemical and oil companies to pay for cleanup of the nation s worst hazardous waste sites  Because the tax has not been reinstated  cleanups are now paid for by all taxpayers    not just polluters  New Jersey has the most Superfund sites in the country  but the administration proposes to cleanup only 40 sites nationwide this year  half the level from the late 90s       The President s budget shortchanges conservation efforts for the Highlands Region  proposing only  2 million  Congress overwhelmingly supported providing  10 million per year for land conservation in this ecologically sensitive region       The Administration s budget will slash the Clean Water Fund by nearly  200 million  For New Jersey  this equals an  8 million cut in federal funding for clean water infrastructure                       Questions or

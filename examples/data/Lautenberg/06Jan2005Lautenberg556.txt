                                                                               Ohio Sec  of State Ken Blackwell was also Co Chairman of Bush Cheney  04 Campaign                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Thursday  January 6  2005      WASHINGTON  DC    During the debate today in Congress over concerns about the electoral process in the critical state of Ohio during the recent Presidential election  United States Senator Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ  announced plans to introduce legislation to ensure that those State officials in charge of supervising the certification of votes for federal elections are not also affiliated with the campaigns of those persons running for federal office        Allowing a state official to oversee a federal election while serving as a campaign official for one of the candidates in that election is a blatant conflict of interest   added Lautenberg       Senator Lautenberg s Federal Election Integrity Act  FEIA  of 2005  to be introduced later this month  would prohibit Secretaries of State and other state election officials with supervisory authority over the administration of federal elections from participating in the political campaign or management of a candidate running for federal office in their state  The Secretary of State is the chief election official in 39 States       In a letter sent out on stationary that appeared to be official Ohio Secretary of State letterhead  Blackwell stated   As the Co Chairman of the Bush Cheney  04 in Ohio  I want to say thank you for helping deliver the great Buckeye State for George W  Bush  Without your enthusiasm  generous support and vote  I m afraid the President would have lost    And an unapologetic liberal Democrat named John Kerry would have won  Thankfully  you and I stopped that disaster from happening   Mr  Blackwell s entire letter is attached to this release        Those officials in charge of certifying elections in the State must not be allowed to serve two masters  The will of the voters must come before the personal politics of those who oversee elections   said Lautenberg       A fact sheet of Sen  Lautenberg s legislation is below       FEDERAL ELECTION INTEGRITY ACT OF 2005 To be introduced by Sen  Frank R  Lautenberg      Senator Lautenberg s Federal Election Integrity Act  FEIA  of 2005 would prohibit Secretaries of State and other state election officials with supervisory authority over the administration of Federal elections from participating in the political campaign or management of a candidate running for Federal office in their state  The FEIA creates a direct prohibition on State election officials from taking part in political campaigns by amending the Federal Campaign Act of 1971       This is not a Democratic or Republican issue  Rather  this is an issue that concerns the preservation of the American people s faith and confidence in the election process  Simply put  an election official responsible for ensuring fair and accurate federal elections should not be connected with any of the candidates in that election       Conflict of Interest      There is an inherent conflict of interest when an election official charged with supervising the administration of an election  and ensuring the fairness and accuracy of the results has a direct role in the campaign of one of the candidates running for Federal office        In the 2004 Presidential election  Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell was co chairman of Bush Cheney  04 in Ohio  On December 6th  2004  Blackwell certified President Bush as the winner in Ohio        This is the second presidential election that presented such a conflict of interest in a critical state  In the 2000 election  Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris served as co chair of President Bush s Florida campaign  President Bush s narrow victory in Florida gave President Bush the state s 25 electoral votes necessary to win the presidency       Authority      Congress has the right to set the rules for fair Federal elections  Thus  Senator Lautenberg s bill does not affect state elections  but only elections for Federal offices  such as President  Vice President  U S  Senator and U S  Representative                    Questions or Comments

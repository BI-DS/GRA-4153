                                                                               Contact  Press Office  202  224 3224 Wednesday  June 6  2007       WASHINGTON  D C    Bipartisan legislation guaranteeing a woman s ability to access birth controlincluding over the counter emergency contraceptionwas introduced by Senator Frank Lautenberg  D NJ  and U S  Representative Carolyn B  Maloney  NY 14  today    The Access to Birth Control  ABC  Act  would make it illegal for a pharmacy to refuse to fill birth control prescriptions and require pharmacies to help  not hinder a woman s ability to access contraception   No woman should be denied the medicine she needs to stay healthy  Lautenberg said  This bill is about basic health care for women in the 21st century  care that shouldn t be withheld by pharmacists with an agenda  Passing this legislation would ensure that women get the care they need and the care that their doctors determine is necessary    An American woman can decide to put her life on the line for our country in Iraq  but she can be prevented from making basic decisions about her own health here at home  said Maloney  Access to birth control is a women s health issue  a private matter and a constitutional right  No one   not pharmacists  politicians  or religious leaders   should be able to tamper with that right   I m pleased to join Senator Lautenberg in introducing this legislation that protects a woman s right to access medication that has been found by the FDA to be medically safe and effective  The FDA s long overdue decision on Plan B last year was a victory for women s health  However  access to birth control and emergency contraception remains a challenge for women across this country  I will work with my colleagues in the Senate and the House of Representatives to support this legislation so that ideology remains separate from science in America  said Clinton  an original co sponsor of the Senate bill   The Access to Birth Control  ABC  Act  would make it illegal for a pharmacy to refuse to fill birth control prescriptions and require pharmacies to help  not hinder a woman s ability to access contraception   Ninety eight percent of American women use birth control at some point in their lives  yet reports of pharmacists denying women their birth control   both prescription and over the counter   have been well documented  It s happening to married women and to single women  to women with children and to women without  Some pharmacists have refused to transfer birth control prescriptions to another more accommodating pharmacy  others have even refused to give the prescription slip back to the customer    Leading women s groups have endorsed the ABC bill  including NARAL Pro Choice America  Planned Parenthood  and the National Women s Law Center  Ninety eight percent of women will use contraception during their lifetimes  It s wrong for pharmacies to allow their employees to block customers  access to birth control  Birth control is basic health care  said Nancy Keenan  president of NARAL Pro Choice America  We need action in Congress because there is a coordinated effort in this country to block women s access to contraception  Just this year 18 state legislatures considered measures that would allow pharmacies or pharmacists to refuse to fill women s birth control prescriptions  Americans are tired of these divisive attacks on women s health and privacy  They want their elected officials to focus on improving women s access to birth control since it s the most commonsense way to prevent unintended pregnancies  That s why we applaud Reps  Maloney  Shays and other cosponsors of the Access to Birth Control Act for standing up to protect  not block  women s access to birth control    Birth control and emergency contraception are basic health care for women  It is 2007    any woman should be able to walk into any pharmacy  anywhere in the country  and get birth control or emergency contraception without discrimination or delay  said Cecile Richards  President of Planned Parenthood Federation of America  Congress should pass the Access to Birth Control Act to ensure that any woman who needs birth control or emergency contraception is able to get it    A woman s likelihood of becoming pregnant increases the longer she waits to take emergency contraception  And even one missed or late birth control pill can put a woman at an increased risk of an unwanted pregnancy   Women who live in rural areas are at an even greater disadvantage when they re denied contraception because they may not have another pharmacy near them to go to  And low income women may not have transportation  or the additional time or money needed to track down a cooperative pharmacy   With this bill  every woman who goes to a pharmacy for contraception will leave with her medication in hand and her dignity in tact  said Judy Waxman  Vice President for Health and Reproductive Rights  National Women s Law Center  The Access to Birth Control Act is an important step toward making sure all women have access to the contraceptives they need and depend on   In addition to guaranteeing women the ability to fill birth control prescriptions  the ABC Bill would make it illegal for a pharmacy to refuse to return a birth control prescription  or for a pharmacist to intimidate  threaten  or harass customers  or intentionally breach  or threaten to breach  medical confidentiality                          Questions or Comments

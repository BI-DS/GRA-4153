NJ   Sen  Robert Menendez  D NJ  and Rep  Frank Pallone  D NJ  today issued a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  and the US Army Corps of Engineers  the federal agencies responsible for protecting the New Jersey coastline  to determine what went wrong this past Labor Day weekend when trash and other debris washed ashore in Ocean County and forced several beaches to close   Several beaches along the Jersey Shore were closed during part of the busy holiday weekend because of the trash that washed ashore The source of the waste    which beachgoers said included syringes  tampon applicators and gauze    was not immediately known   Too many Labor Day holidays were cut short when garbage washed ashore and forced authorities to close our beaches  said Sen  Lautenberg Beachgoers are supposed to be protected from these slicks by a coordinated effort of surveillance and response from state and federal agencies  We need to know what went wrong so we can keep our beaches open and prevent this from happening again   The thousands of vacationers who were disappointed by closed beaches over the holiday weekend know firsthand that the plan to keep the shore clean must be solidified  said Sen  Menendez  Its priority for our states environment  for our states economy and for all of us who love the Jersey Shore   Since 1989  we have worked to improve beach quality along the Jersey Shore with the Floatables Action Plan  Rep  Pallone said Along the way  EPA made changes to address problems that arose After the garbage wash up in Ocean County over the Labor Day Weekend  it s clear that EPA needs to once again investigate what went wrong so that we can continue to strengthen this program to protect beachgoers in the future   It is like any plumbing system When it works  you take it for granted  but when it breaks  watch out The NJ NY Estuary Floatable Action Plan is a national model  when it works The failures that caused this slick to escape into the ocean must be determined and corrected Not only does this garbage pollute beaches  it is harmful to marine life We applaud the leadership and action of US Senator Lautenberg  US Senator Menendez and US Representative Pallone to track down the cracks in the program  so they can be fixed  said Cindy Zipf  Executive Director of Clean Ocean Action   The Floatables Action Plan was developed in 1989 in response to the massive garbage slicks and beach closures that took place the previous two summers Numerous agencies coordinate efforts to carry out this plan  which works to prevent garbage from washing ashore by conducting aerial surveillance for slicks in the New York New Jersey Harbor These agencies are charged with cleaning up slicks as quickly as possible    The agencies  including the EPA  are responsible for conducting aerial surveillance to search for floating debris  If and when debris is located  these agencies are supposed to notify the US Army Corps of Engineers  which then sends skimmer vessels to the area for clean up         The following is the letter Sen  Lautenberg  Sen  Menendez and Rep  Pallone issued to the EPA and US Army Corps of Engineers     The Honorable Alan Steinberg Administrator  Region 2 U S  Environmental Protection Agency  1200 Pennsylvania Ave   N W  Washington  D C  20460  Colonel Aniello L  Tortora  New York District  United States Corps of Engineers  26 Federal Plaza  New York  New York 10278  Dear Regional Administrator Steinberg and Colonel Tortora   We are writing in response to the recent reports of large amounts of garbage and debris washing up on the beaches of New Jersey We are greatly disturbed that the NY NJ Harbor Estuary Floatables Action Plan did not identify and prevent the heavy wash up of garbage that led to beach closures over the holiday weekend The debris has caused beach closings in Normandy Beach  NJ  and many other municipalities reported greater than usual amounts of trash on their beaches In addition  during the week of August 20th  a forewarning wash up occurred along the northern Bayshore region and caused beach closures in Middletown  NJ    As you know  in 1989 the Army Corps of Engineers  ACOE  and the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  Region 2 designed the Floatables Action Plan to identify and remove garbage slicks from the New York New Jersey Harbor  to prevent beach closures and adverse impacts on coastal species and commercial and recreational boating To date  the plan has been successful in reducing garbage in the harbor and subsequently diminished the number of beach closures resulting from debris waste   However the recent beach closures raise serious questions about the Floatables Action Plan Please provide information on whether there was a breakdown in the Plan that led to this debris wash up  In addition  please identify any suggested changes that may lead to the improvement of the Plan and provide information on whether this Plan is adequately funded    It is important to our constituents that we work together to address these problems Our coastal environment has been steadily improving over the last 15 years  thanks to the collective efforts of many federal  state and local agencies We must continue to work together so that we do not go back to the time when debris and trash plagued our waterways and beaches    Thank you for your attention to this matter  We look forward to continuing to work together                          Questions or Comments

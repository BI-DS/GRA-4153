conservative radio commentator and columnist almost a quarter of a million dollars to skew his reporting to promote the No Child Left Behind Act  United States Senators Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ   Edward Kennedy  D MA  and Harry Reid  D NV  sent a letter to President Bush today demanding that he recover the money paid to Armstrong Williams  citing federal laws that prohibit such activity  In addition  the lawmakers also asked President Bush to disclose any payments to other journalists to push Administration policies  including President Bush s decision to privatize Social Security       In news reports today  it was revealed conservative pundit and commentator Armstrong Williams was paid  240 000 to promote President Bush s No Child Left Behind Act on his syndicated radio program and in addition  to urge other pundits to routinely hype the law during their own appearances on other programs       In their letter to President Bush  the Lawmakers cite federal laws that prohibit taxpayer funds from being spent by the Executive Branch for  Covert Propaganda         In addition to the illegality of these actions taken by your Administration  we believe that the act of bribing journalists to bias their news in favor of government policies undermines the integrity of our democracy  Actions like this were common in the Soviet Union  but until now  thought to be long extinguished in our country   wrote the lawmakers in their letter to President Bush sent today       These revelations regarding Mr  Williams are the latest    and most disturbing    in a series of actions by your Administration to manipulate public opinion through covert propaganda  On May 19  2004  the GAO found that your Administration illegally spent taxpayer funds on covert propaganda by paying Ketchum Incorporated to produce fake news stories promoting the image of the new Medicare law         More       The links below are examples of syndicated columns published by the Tribune

Dear President Bush       We are writing to urge you to immediately terminate    and recover funds from   the contract between your administration and the journalist Armstrong Williams  According to media reports   240 000 in taxpayer funds were transferred to Mr  Williams in exchange for his agreement to promote the Administration s  No Child Left Behind  initiative on his broadcasts and to interview Education Secretary Rod Paige during his television and radio programs  These payments to Mr  Williams constitute a clear violation of the  Publicity and Propaganda  laws recently passed by Congress  The payments also violated the Antideficiency Act        In addition to recovering these funds  we would urge you to disclose if any other journalists have been paid by your Administration to skew their media reports in favor of your initiatives  proposals or political messages  For example  have any journalists or media organizations been paid by your Administration to promote your Social Security privatization plan or otherwise promote the idea of a  crisis  in Social Security       The Government Accountability Office  GAO  has stated numerous times that  under the laws cited above  taxpayer funds cannot be used by the Executive Branch for activities in which the  obvious purpose is  self aggrandizement  or  puffery    The GAO has specifically cited messages that conceal the government s role as illegal  covert propaganda         In addition to the illegality of these actions taken by your Administration  we believe that the act of bribing journalists to bias their news in favor of government policies undermines the integrity of our democracy  Actions like this were common in the Soviet Union  but until now  thought to be long extinguished in our country       These revelations regarding Mr  Williams are the latest    and most disturbing    in a series of actions by your Administration to manipulate public opinion through covert propaganda  On May 19  2004  the GAO found that your Administration illegally spent taxpayer funds on covert propaganda by paying Ketchum Incorporated to produce fake news stories promoting the image of the new Medicare law  This week  the GAO found that fake news stories produced by the Office of National Drug Control Policy also violated the  Publicity and Propaganda  clause  In addition  on November 19  2004  the GAO launched a new inquiry into the legality of the Department of Education s contract with Ketchum to produce fake news stories and create favorability rankings of journalists  Good government means that our citizens can trust that government policies put the public s interest first  We don t need  payola  and public relations to educate our kids  We need good teachers  good schools and good standards        Again  we urge you to take immediate action to recover funds from the contracts with Mr  Williams and any other contracts your Administration has entered into with journalists to distort their news or editorial coverage        Sincerely       FRANK R  LAUTENBERG       EDWARD M  KENNEDY      HARRY REID                   Questions or Comments

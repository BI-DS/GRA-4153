Lautenberg  D NJ  along with Rep  Rob Andrews  D NJ   today issued a letter to the Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  urging them to hold hearings in southern New Jersey on airspace redesign plans for the region        In their letter  the legislators expressed concern that residents from South Jersey have been unable to sufficiently voice their opinions on the redesign proposal which could have a large impact on their quality of life  Meetings have previously been held in North Jersey  too far for many in the southern region of the state to attend  and in Philadelphia  which was so heavily attended that several hundred people had to be turned away  To date  no meetings have been held in the southern part of the state      Residents in South Jersey who will be impacted by the redesign plan are especially concerned over increased noise from a higher level of air traffic and the impact on their quality of life and property value  On March 23  the senators wrote a letter to the FAA expressing their concerns over the airspace redesign plans  specifically citing the impact it would have on Gloucester County  http   menendez senate gov pdf FAAairspaceredesign3 23 07 pdf   Last year the senators joined with members of the New Jersey house delegation in expressing their apprehensions about an FAA proposal and its statewide effects  http   menendez senate gov newsroom record cfm id 257999                 Full text of the letter appears below       The Honorable Marion Blakey  Administrator  Federal Aviation Administration  800 Independence Ave   S W   Washington  DC 20591         Dear Administrator Blakey       We write regarding the public meetings the Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  recently held regarding its plans for New York New Jersey Philadelphia airspace redesign   These public meetings are designed to provide an opportunity for residents of communities affected by your agency s plan to learn details of the impact and have their questions answered   However  we think the meetings held thus far did not provide an adequate opportunity for those who will be affected by the FAA plan to learn of the impact and voice their concerns       We learned with dismay that at the most recent meeting  which took place on May 1 in Essington  Pennsylvania  hundreds of area residents were not able to have their concerns heard   Given the overwhelming response in attendance it is clear that many are concerned about the FAA s plans   We believe the FAA should take into account the severe impact this proposal would have on many residents across the state   As the FAA has proposed  this airspace redesign plan could significantly alter the quality of life some 300 000 New Jerseyans  exposing them to increased noise and lowering their property values   Furthermore  the planned flight patterns would affect residents from very different parts of the State         We are particularly displeased that our previous requests for an additional meeting have gone ignored   Before these meetings took place  we expressed our concerns to you that many New Jersey residents  specifically those in Gloucester County  would not have sufficient opportunity to participate in the public meeting process because of the insufficient effort FAA was making to accommodate them          Given the extenuating circumstances of the meeting in Pennsylvania  we urge you to provide New Jerseyans another opportunity to hear from the FAA on these plans   For many New Jersey residents in the southern part of our State  the Pennsylvania meeting location was closer than the meeting held in Newark  New Jersey   Because of the direct impact the redesign would have on communities in southern New Jersey  we urge you find a location that is convenient for residents from this region         We thank you for your immediate consideration of this matter   New Jerseyans should be given sufficient opportunity to learn about the impacts of the plan and provide their feedback   Until this occurs  the redesign should not move forward                               Questions or Comments

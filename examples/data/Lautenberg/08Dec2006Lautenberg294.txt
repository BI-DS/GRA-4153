Homes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Contact  Alex Formuzis  202  224 7340 Friday  December 8  2006        WASHINGTON  D C     To better protect American families in their homes  United States Senator Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ  yesterday help steer passage of the Pipeline Inspection  Protection  Enforcement and Safety  PIPES  Act of 2006   H R  5782   a bill that will require excess flow valves to be installed on all new or replacement pipes in single family homes   These inexpensive safety valves can automatically shut off a ruptured line  which helps prevent injury  protect property and save lives         A gas leak in a home can be a silent killer   With the strong safety provisions we  ve enacted today  like requiring new or replacement homes to have emergency valves  we can help people feel more comfortable that the pipes leading into their homes are safe     Lautenberg said        Lautenberg is a leader on surface transportation issues in the Senate  s Commerce  Science and Transportation Committee  which has jurisdiction over pipeline safety   The Committee is co chaired by Senators Daniel Inouye  D HI  and Ted Stevens  R AK    Lautenberg first introduced legislation to strengthen federal oversight of pipelines in 1995      The bill also authorizes more federal pipeline safety inspectors  50 percent over the 4 years life of the bill  to inspect country  s 2 3 million miles of natural gas  oil  and hazardous liquid pipelines  and creates new regulations for the nation  s low stress oil transmission pipelines  including those in Prudhoe Bay  Alaska   This summer  the nation faced a major oil shortage when the Prudhoe Bay line was partially shut down due to severe corrosion  and poor maintenance and inspection   Prudhoe Bay produces 400 000 barrels of oil a day      Senator Lautenberg has worked to improve pipeline safety and security since 1994  when a gas pipeline exploded in Edison  New Jersey   The resulting explosion and fire burned eight apartment buildings to the ground  left 128 families homeless and sent 1 500 people running for safety   Federal investigations found the use of automatic safety valves would have prevented much of the damage        A summary of the PIPES Act is attached to this release      SUMMARY OF PIPELINE INSPECTION  PROTECTION  ENFORCEMENT  AND SAFETY ACT OF 2006  PIPES ACT      The bill reauthorizes federal pipeline safety programs  which are administered by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration  PHMSA   for Fiscal Years 2007 through 2010   Highlights of the bill include      Increased Federal Resources Dedicated to Overseeing Pipeline Safety The bill provides  6 million for an additional 45 federal inspectors  a 50  increase  during its four year authorization period   Currently PHMSA has 90 inspectors  but the DOT Inspector General has stated that this relatively low staffing level is a matter for concern   This current staffing level translates to one federal inspector for every 18 000 miles of pipeline nationwide   This funding increase  along with the bulk of the bill  is paid for with user fees and will not raise the deficit      Strengthened Programs to Reduce Construction Related Damage to Pipelines The bill includes new civil enforcement authority against excavators and pipeline operators responsible for third party damage incidents and provides grants to states that have damage prevention programs   Construction related damage  such as damage caused by excavation for a highway project  is the greatest cause of pipeline accidents that result in death or injury  with the number of third party damage incidents up dramatically over the past several years   Damage from such incidents often impacts the local natural gas pipeline distribution systems that run through the neighborhoods where people live and work      Mandates Use of Excess Flow Valves in New Single Family Residences The bill mandates that all new single family residences or replaced service lines in single family residences have an excess flow valve installed   This safety device automatically shuts off the flow of gas when a rupture occurs   The National Transportation Safety Board recommends their use where feasible      Applying DOT Safety Standards to the Currently Unregulated Low Stress Pipelines The bill requires DOT oversight and regulation of the nation  s low stress transmission pipelines  including those in Prudhoe Bay  Alaska involved in accidents this year   In August  the DOT announced a proposed rule to cover low stress pipelines in unusually sensitive areas   The bill and the proposed rule alike would require pipeline operators to meet new safety regulations  including cleaning and continuous monitoring   However  the DOT proposal would cover about only 1 200 miles of pipelines  leaving the vast majority of low stress lines not in sensitive areas unregulated        Increased Accountability of Pipeline Company Officials The bill requires senior officials at pipeline companies to certify that the information they provide to regulators is accurate                          Questions or

                                                                              Lautenberg Says Justice Dept  Tobacco Turnabout  Reeks  of Political Interference                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Wednesday  June 8  2005      WASHINGTON    In response to the decision by the Bush Department of Justice to decrease the amount of compensation owed to American taxpayers by tobacco companies from  130 billion to  10 billion  United States Senators Frank  R  Lautenberg  D NJ   Edward M  Kennedy  D MA   Richard Durbin  D IL  and Ron Wyden  D OR  used a Capitol Hill news conference to blast the decision by the Administration  Lautenberg and the other lawmakers sent a letter to the Inspector General at the Justice Department demanding an immediate investigation  Senators Tom Harkin  D IA  and Bill Nelson  D FL  also signed on to the letter         This reeks of political interference by the Bush Administration   said Lautenberg   Big Tobacco is one of the top donors to Republicans  and it is getting what it paid for  When faced with a choice between protecting a generation of American children or a rogue industry  the Bush Administration chose the industry        Lautenberg is the author of the 1987 law banning smoking on airline flights  He is also the author of the 1994 law requiring all buildings housing Federally funded children s programs to be smoke free  This includes all public schools  federally funded day care centers and WIC programs  Senator Lautenberg also introduced one of the first bills in Congress to make the tobacco companies pay for the Medicare and Medicaid costs associated with tobacco use        The Clinton Administration rose above politics and initiated this critical lawsuit to compensate taxpayers for the cost of the tobacco industry s misdeeds   said Lautenberg   Now the Bush Administration is caving to the influence of Big Tobacco s political power        The text of the letter is attached to this release       June 8  2005      The Honorable Glenn A  Fine Inspector General U S  Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General 950 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW  Suite 4322 Washington  D C  20530 0001      Dear Mr  Fine       We are writing because of our deep concern over recent events in the government s landmark case against the major tobacco companies  United States v  Philip Morris USA Inc  et al  Like all of those who have closely followed the case  we were shocked by the position that the Justice Department took in court yesterday on the crucial issue of damages  The government had presented extensive expert testimony that  130 billion would be needed to finance a comprehensive national smoking cessation program to counteract the harm caused by the defendants  highly addictive product  Rather than base its claim for damages on the evidence presented by its own expert  the Justice Department inexplicably asked the Court to order the companies to pay only  10 billion  less than eight percent of the amount the government is entitled to recover based on the trial record  This action appears to seriously compromise the government s position in the case  undermining our ability to obtain a strong and effective remedy for the egregious misconduct of the defendants       What is particularly disturbing are news reports that the career Justice Department attorneys who have pursued the case against the tobacco industry for more than six years wanted to seek the full  130 billion to fund smoking cessation programs  but were overruled by high ranking political appointees        According to today s Washington Post        Sources and government officials close to the case said the trial lawyers wanted to request  130 billion for smoking cessation programs  but were pressured by leaders in the attorney general s office  particularly  Associate Attorney General Robert D   McCallum  to make the cut        The Los Angeles Times made a similar report        A person familiar with the situation  speaking on a condition of anonymity  said the change was  forced on the tobacco team by higher level  politically appointed officials of the Justice Department   including Associate Atty  Gen  Robert McCallum  who oversees the civil division   There should be a thorough investigation to determine whether there was in fact political interference in the prosecution of this case       No credible explanation has been offered to explain the Department s sudden abandonment of the evidence based remedy which had been established through lengthy  detailed expert testimony  The legitimacy of the  10 billion claim for damages made by the Department yesterday is called into question by the very testimony that the government painstakingly presented over the last year       In light of these disturbing facts  we request the Office of the Inspector General to investigate the manner in which the decision to reduce the claim for damages from  130 billion to  10 billion was made  and to determine whether improper interference by political appointees led to a reversal of the position advocated by the career professionals working on the case  In light of the urgency of this matter  we request that this investigation be afforded high priority by your office       EDWARD M  KENNEDY

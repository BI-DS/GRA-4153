                                                                               Wednesday  February 9  2005      WASHINGTON  DC    President Bush s budget proposal for Fiscal Year 2006 calls for a major tax increase on airline passengers  said United States Senator Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ   President Bush wants to increase the taxes passengers pay for an airline ticket by an additional  3 00  Passengers already pay nearly 20 percent in Federal taxes when purchasing a plane ticket        For example  the tax burden on the average domestic round trip base fare of  230 85 is currently  45 87    an effective tax rate of 19 9 percent  President Bush wants to increase these already high taxes        While millionaires are receiving massive tax cuts  President Bush wants everyday people who fly to pick up the tab for his Administration s budget woes   said Lautenberg   It isn t fair that a small business person should have to be hit with more taxes on airline travel while giant corporations and their executives get a huge tax cut from President Bush  President Bush is using the smokescreen of his massive budget to hide this tax increase  but now that the fog has lifted  he needs to withdraw this awful idea         Current Federal Taxes on Domestic Air Travel      Average Domestic Round Trip Fare  230 85 Federal Excise Tax  7 5    17 31 Federal Segment Tax   3 20  2 8 segments  8 96 September 11th Security Fee   2 50   2 8 segments  7 00 Passenger Facility Charge   4 50   2 8 segments  12 60      Total Taxes  Before Bush Increase    45 87       President Bush spent the better part of last year scaring the American people that his opponent in the campaign would raise their taxes  and now one of the first things he proposes is a tax increase on millions of Americans   Lautenberg said   Going back on his word right out of the gates in his second term should be a warning sign to the American people of what is to come        Lautenberg s letter to the President is below       February 9  2005      GeorgeW  Bush President The White House Washington DC 20500      Dear PresidentBush       The Americanpeople will be shocked to learn that you are proposing a major tax increase in the budgetyou presentedto Congresson Monday  Specifically you are asking Congress to increase the airline passenger tax by an additional  3 00 per ticket  Such a tax increase is an unacceptable burden on the traveling public given the enormous amount of federal taxes that passengers currently pay on airline tickets  nearly 20 percent of the base fare price       I request that you publicly withdraw this proposed tax increase and direct your Administration not to seek its implementation       The tax burden on airline passengers is already too much  For example  the federal tax on the average domestic round trip base fare of  230 85 is  45 87   an effective tax rate of 19 9 percent  The various federal passengertaxes pile up on one another  the Federal Excise Tax on top of the Federal SegmentTax on top of the September 11th Security Fee on top of the Passenger Facility Charge       Your proposed tax increase on everyday Americans is especially troubling in the context of the major tax breaks for the richest Americans you have pushed through Congressin the past few years  This year alone  those tax breaks will reduce the tax bill of the average millionaire by over  100 000  Shiftingthe tax burden from millionaires to Americans who need to travel to see their children  grandchildren  other family members or small businesspartners is simply unfair       I am one of the strongest advocates for more transportation security resources in Congress  But we cannot balance the budgeton the backs of the traveling public and small business people       You campaigned on a message of fear that your opponent would raise taxes upon taking office  However  it turns out that the first act of your new term includes a proposal to raise taxes on millions of American families       Sincerely       U S  Senator Frank R  Lautenberg                       Questions or Comments

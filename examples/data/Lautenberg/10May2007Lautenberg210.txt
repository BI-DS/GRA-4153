                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Contact  Press Office  202  224 3224 Thursday  May 10  2007      WASHINGTON  D C    Sens  Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ  and Robert Menendez  D NJ  today urged the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  to take immediate action to remove capacitors leaking cancer causing PCBs from the Bound Brook adjacent to the Superfund site that housed Cornell Dubilier Electronics in South Plainfield         In addition  in their letter to EPA Administrator Steve Johnson sent today  the Senators urged the agency to implement an aggressive program to warn residents of the dangers of consuming fish or other exposure to toxic contaminants from the site       Sen  Lautenberg  a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee  visited the Superfund site in February to say the EPA was proceeding too slowly in cleaning up the country s hazardous waste sites         New Jersey has more Superfund sites than any other state in the nation   The South Plainfield site  which  according to the EPA  is highly contaminated with PCBs  23 metals and 19 pesticides  was added in 1998        A copy of the letter is attached                Dear Administrator Johnson       We are writing to request that the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  take immediate action to address the human health and environmental threats from capacitor and asbestos disposal areas located in the vicinity of the Bound Brook  adjacent to the Cornell Dubilier Electronics Superfund Site in South Plainfield  New Jersey   These capacitors were discovered by the Edison Wetlands Association  EWA  during a recent stream inspection as part of their Raritan River Project         While we appreciate the immediate removal of some of the capacitors leaking into the Bound Brook  we believe EPA needs to fully respond to this public health threat and address it in its entirety immediately   As you know  the Cornell Dubilier Electronics Superfund Site is listed by your Agency as a site where human exposure is not under control  EWA sampling revealed PCB levels up to 260 000 parts per million  as well as extremely high levels of asbestos  in a stream corridor draining directly through popular public fishing areas   The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection residential cleanup criteria for PCBs is  49 parts per million   The PCB levels in the fish in the Bound Brook are some of the highest levels in the State of New Jersey           EPA s Preliminary Conceptual Site Model Report of 2006  makes clear that your agency recognizes the serious health risks posed to local residents   This report states that children and adults are potentially being exposed to the floodplain soils of the Bound Brook through playing  landscaping  gardening and exercise   In addition  this report notes that residents may be consuming contaminated fish they catch and may be unaware of current fishing advisories  due to a lack of adequate warning signs       Based on the extreme levels of contamination at this site and the potential for human exposure and serious damage to our natural resources  we urge the EPA to immediately utilize the Superfund Emergency Removal Program to excavate and dispose of all the capacitors  remnants of capacitors  other similar items  and asbestos in the Bound Brook floodplain   The EPA needs to physically inspect both sides of the Bound Brook  particularly on the banks  to address this hazardous waste and prevent further migration downstream        Following this removal action  we urge EPA to implement an expedited sampling program to locate any additional areas or material that may be contaminating the Bound Brook   A comprehensive investigation of the area must be implemented to define the extent of the PCB disposal area and to design its complete removal  These wastes represent a continuing source of PCB contamination to the Bound Brook  and actions in this portion of the Cornell Dubilier Superfund Site must be given top priority by the Agency        Finally  EPA should implement an aggressive community notification program to inform residents along the Bound Brook of the dangers associated with consuming fish or coming into contact with site related contaminants   This should include the installation of numerous bilingual signs along the Brook and holding public meetings in the municipalities potentially impacted by the PCB contamination in the Bound Brook  including South Plainfield  Piscataway  Middlesex Borough  Bound Brook and South Bound Brook       We appreciate the work that EPA is currently conducting at this site  including the demolition of contaminated buildings   However  in addition to these buildings  it appears that these capacitors and contaminated sediments may pose a significant additional threat and we urge you to respond accordingly         Thank you for your consideration of this critical matter   We look forward to your reply

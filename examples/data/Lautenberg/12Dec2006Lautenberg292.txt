Senators Frank R  Lautenberg  D N J    Dick Durbin  D    Ill    Chuck Schumer  D    N Y   and Hillary Rodham Clinton  D    N Y   and Robert Menendez  D   N J   sent a letter to the heads of the Food and Drug Administration  FDA   the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  and the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  to call for the creation of a joint task force to examine the recent E  coli outbreaks in New Jersey  New York  Delaware  South Carolina and Utah   The task force would report to Congress and the public on the cause of these incidents and recommend changes in laws and regulations to protect American  s food and health         We urge your agencies to convene a multi agency task force and develop recommendations on how to effectively address the problem of foodborne illness associated with fresh produce   These latest incidents illustrate that we need to do more to reduce the risk of food borne illness in our country   At greatest risk are older Americans  children  pregnant women  and those with weakened immune systems     the Senators wrote   The letter is addressed to FDA Commissioner Andrew C  von Eschenbach  CDC Director Julie Gerberding  and Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns      Since early December  at least 169 people have been sickened by E  Coli after eating at restaurants affiliated with the same fast food chain   There is strong evidence that this outbreak can be linked to produce used in these restaurants   Earlier this year  E  coli contaminated spinach killed at least 3 people and sickened more than 200        Produce has also been linked to previous foodborne disease outbreaks   In 2004  an outbreak of Hepatitis A was traced to lettuce and tomatoes in California   The outbreak made 14 people ill   In 2003  an outbreak of Hepatitis A in Pennsylvania was traced to green onions from a Chi Chi  s restaurant   The outbreak killed 4 people and sickened 600         A copy of the full letter is attached to this release         December 12  2006      The Honorable Mike Johanns    Secretary of Agriculture    U S  Department of Agriculture     1400 Independence Avenue  S W      Washington  D C  20250     Dr  Andrew C  von Eschenbach    Commissioner    Food and Drug Administration    5600 Fishers Lane    Rockville  MD 20857     Dr  Julie Gerberding    Director    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention    1600 Clifton Road NE    Atlanta  GA 30333              Dear Secreatary Johanns  Dr  Von Eschenbach  and Dr  Gerberding      We are writing to urge your agencies to immediately form a joint task force on the recent E  coli outbreaks  and that this task force report to Congress and the public on the cause of these incidents and what changes in law and regulation are needed to prevent future problems      As you are aware  since early December  at least 169 people in New Jersey  New York  Delaware  South Carolina and Utah have been sickened  by E  coli 0157 H7  a deadly and aggressive strain of the bacteria   Most of these people ate at restaurants affiliated with the same fast food chain   There is strong evidence that this outbreak can be traced to produce used in these restaurants        We urge your agencies to convene a multi agency task force and develop recommendations on how to effectively address the problem of foodborne illness associated with fresh produce   We would welcome your recommendations on what changes in law may need to be made by Congress  and what steps can be taken at the agency level   We would strongly encourage the task force to take into consideration the views of appropriate interested parties  such as small farmers and other growers  food safety consumer groups  industry representatives  and state agencies            The latest outbreak is not the first time that fresh produce has been linked to a foodborne disease outbreak  in 2003  an outbreak of Hepatitis A in Pennsylvania  which killed 4 people and sickened 600  was traced to green onions from a Chi Chi  s restaurant   Earlier this year  E  coli contaminated spinach killed at least 3 people and sickened over 200   While the FDA has issued voluntary food safety guidance to the produce industry over the years  these recent outbreaks indicate that this voluntary approach may be insufficient to protect the public       According to USDA  s Economic Research Service  hazards in food cause an estimated 76 million illnesses  325 000 hospitalizations  and 5 000 deaths in the United States each year  this is most likely an underestimation as many occurrences of foodborne illness are never reported to public health officials   At greatest risk are older Americans  children  pregnant women  and those with weakened immune systems   These latest incidents illustrate that we need to do more to reduce the risk of food borne illness in our country      Thank you for your consideration of this request        Sincerely     Frank R  Lautenberg Richard Durbin

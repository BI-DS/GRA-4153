                                                                                Contact  Press Office  202  224 3224 Wednesday  December 12  2007      WASHINGTON  D C   Sen  Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ  and Sen  Barbara Boxer  D CA  today said a new General Accountability Office  GAO  report shows how the Bush administration has worked to undermine the Public Right to Know law that informs people about the release of toxic chemicals in their communities  Sens  Lautenberg and Boxer said the GAO report demonstrates the need for Congress to approve legislation to overturn the Environmental Protection Agencys  EPA  rules weakening toxic reporting requirements that had been in place for nearly two decades   People who live near chemical facilities have a right to know about the potential poisons released into their air and water  Unfortunately  this report makes clear the Bush Administration is putting politics ahead of science and letting facilities hide critical data about toxic chemicals  This disturbing report shows the Administration pushed to weaken the publics right to know about the release of dozens of toxic chemicals from thousands of facilities nationwide  It is time to overturn this rule and restore the publics right to know about the release of toxic chemicals in their communities  said Sen  Frank R  Lautenberg  who authored the legislation that created the 1986 Right to Know program    Senator Boxer said  The public has a right to know about toxic pollution in local communities  The Bush administrations EPA has rolled back that right for special interests at the publics expense  GAOs report confirms the serious flaws in EPAs process and emboldens me to press ahead to restore the publics right to know and move forward on Senator Lautenbergs legislation    At the request of Sens  Lautenberg  Boxer and Olympia Snowe  R ME   the GAO prepared a written report on the EPAs December 2006 rulemaking under the Toxics Release Inventory  TRI  program  TRI is the preeminent federal public right to know program for toxic chemicals  Health officials  federal  state and local governments  business  and the public use TRI to reduce chemical threats to public health    The GAO concluded that     The rule could significantly reduce environmental information on dozens of toxic chemicals released from thousands of facilities across the country    EPAs rule would allow more than 3 500 facilities to no longer report detailed information about their toxic chemical releases and waste management practices   EPA did not follow key steps in agency guidelines designed to ensure that it conducts appropriate scientific  economic  and policy analysis    S enior EPA management directed inclusion of a burden reduction optionin response to direction from OMB and issued the rule to meet a burden reduction commitment to OMB   EPAs burden reduction estimates used outdated data and are likely  25   overstated   EPA issued the rule despite over 100 000 commentsthe vast majority expressed opposition to EPAs proposed changes  whereas about 30 commenters expressed support    The Right to Know law creating TRI was authored by Sen  Lautenberg and passed into law in 1986 as part of the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act  The law came in the wake of the tragic disaster at a Union Carbide facility in Bhopal  India  which killed thousands of people  Congress passed the law to ensure that communities know how much of a variety of dangerous industrial chemicals are released into the air  water and the ground    In December 2006  the EPA announced final rules that weakened reporting requirements for the TRI  With these rules  the Bush administration has undermined this critical program by eliminating detailed reports from thousands of facilities nationwide that release up to 2 000 pounds of chemicals every year and eliminating detailed reporting requirements for facilities that manage up to 500 pounds of chemicals known to pose some of the worst threats to human health  including lead and mercury    Sen  Lautenbergs new legislation  the Toxic Right to Know Protection Act  reinstates the stronger reporting requirements that were in place before the Bush administration weakened them late last year Sen  Boxer is an original co sponsor of the Lautenberg bill     The Toxic Right to Know Protection Act passed the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee  which is chaired by Sen  Boxer   Sen  Robert Menendez  D NJ  is an original cosponsor of the Lautenberg bill  Rep  Frank Pallone  D NJ 06  and Rep  Hilda Solis  D CA 32  have introduced the companion version of the bill in the House of Representatives                          Questions or Comments

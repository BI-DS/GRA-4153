                                                                               Contact  Press Office  202  224 3224 Tuesday  June 12  2007      WASHINGTON  D C   Today  Senator Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ  introduced a bill to protect the safety and security of Americas homeland and our regional and national economy from potentially hazardous non containerized cargoes transported by ship   Ships bringing liquefied natural gas from foreign portsand the plants along our shores that receive themmust be better secured against terrorism  Senator Lautenberg said  This bill would require the Bush Administration to adequately protect those ships  facilities  and nearby communities from the potential hazards of high risk cargoes   The Maritime Hazardous Cargo Security Act of 2007 would require the U S  Department of Homeland Security to improve security for the vessels and facilities that ship and receive particularly dangerous chemicals and petrochemicals  To improve security  Lautenbergs bill contains several key provisions  including    A requirement for the Bush Administration to work with international partners to develop standards and procedures for the safe and secure handling of especially hazardous cargoes  EHC  for all vessels and port facilities     An employee security training requirement for port workers to successfully complete training on the Coast Guards Incident Command System     A requirement for the U S  Coast Guard to develop regional response and recovery plans for the resumption of commerce after disruption by a security incident     Authorization for the U S  Coast Guard to share EHC security costs with high risk U S  facilities  and a requirement for the Bush Administration to develop realistic budget requirements for the U S  Coast Guard EHC security costs    The bill is also cosponsored by bipartisan leaders on the Senate Commerce Committee and the Subcommittee on Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine Safety  Security  and Infrastructure  which Lautenberg chairs  A fact sheet on the bill is attached          Lautenberg Maritime Hazardous Cargo Security Act Of 2007 FACT SHEET  Maritime Hazardous Cargo Security Act of 2007 Cosponsored by Senators Inouye  Stevens  and Smith  On June 12  2007  Senator Lautenberg introduced the Maritime Hazardous Cargo Security Act of 2007  This bill will require strengthening of federal protections against terrorist attacks on facilities and vessels that transport  handle  and store especially hazardous cargoes  EHCs   The transportation of EHCs by ship can pose a significant risk to the public safety and the economic security of the nation  particularly the transportation of chemicals and petrochemicals such as anhydrous ammonia  ammonium nitrate  chlorine  liquefied natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas  Currently  no international standards exist for the safe and secure handling of these chemicals petrochemicals by ship and limited U S  Coast Guard resources for EHC security poses a dangerous risk to our communities       SECURITY RISKS OF MARITIME TRANSPORT OF EHCs     Identified by DHS   U S  Department of Homeland Security officials have identified vulnerabilities of EHC facilities vessels to the public at large      Inherent Dangers of EHCs   Studies have shown that under certain conditions there is potential for wide area fires and deadly heat waves reaching over a mile from the source      Recently  2004   an accident at an EHC plant in Algeria killed 27 and injured 74       Vessels Themselves as Terrorist Targets   Maritime vessels themselves have been targeted by terrorists  including an attack on the Limburg in 2002  Yemeni tank vessel        Federal agencies have received at least 70 applications to build new facilities in the U S  which will receive EHC shipments from tank vessels  Many of these facilities will receive shipments from foreign ports  requiring the need to address international  system wide safety and security risks   The bill would    Require the Bush Administration to work with international partners through the International Maritime Organization  IMO  to develop standards and procedures for the safe and secure receiving  handling  loading and unloading of EHCs at facilities and to and from tank vessels     Require the U S  Coast Guard to calculate its security costs for additional security measures associated with the operation of U S  shore side EHC facilities and authorize arrangements for the sharing of costs with certain high risk facilities     Authorize assistance to foreign ports that handle and transport EHCs to be used to meet or exceed current International Ship and Port Facility Code  ISPFC  standards     Authorize voluntary third party validation of international port facilities to certify they meet or exceed international safety standards     Require the U S  Coast Guard to develop regional response and recovery plans to prepare for and respond to a transportation security incident     Require the U S  Coast Guard to develop a resource allocation plan to show how its proposed budget will be used for EHC security operations and to report to Congress biannually     Require successful completion of U S  Coast Guard Incident Command System  ICS  training for all personnel responsible for the safety and security of a vessel in port

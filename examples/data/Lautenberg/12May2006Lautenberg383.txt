                                                                              Lawmakers Call on Bush Admin  to Extend Monday Deadline for Medicare Drugs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Friday  May 12  2006      ELIZABETH  N J     As a Monday deadline looms that could penalize 360 000 senior citizens in New Jersey  Senators Frank R  Lautenberg and Robert Menendez  Congressmen Frank Pallone and Donald Payne today called on the Bush Administration to extend the signup period for the new Medicare prescription drug plan through the end of the year       During a meeting with senior citizens  the lawmakers announced that they had sent a letter to Health and Human Services  HHS  Secretary Michael Leavitt demanding that the Administration lift the deadline  Secretary Leavitt was in New Jersey at an event in Somerset today where he defended the Medicare deadline        This  Medicare Maze  of a drug plan is just too complicated to pressure people to make a quick decision   said Senator Lautenberg   New Jersey Seniors shouldn t be penalized because the Medicare drug plan is so confusing  Time is running out  and the Administration needs to act now         The outcry I hear in New Jersey and across the country hasn t changed   Menendez said  Seniors and their families need more time to figure out how the new program works and which drug plan is best for them  Instead of penalizing our seniors for taking a little more time in choosing a plan  the Bush administration should be providing them with more time to weigh through this complex program         Secretary Leavitt can march around the country all he wants touting the plan and the deadline  but he can t ignore the fact that seniors are receiving inaccurate or incomplete information 60 percent of the time they call the 1 800 MEDICARE line   Congressman Pallone said   Seniors are still rightfully confused  and the Bush administration shouldn t even consider a deadline until it finally gets all its facts straight          Because the program pushed through by the Republican controlled Congress is so complex  it is unreasonable to impose this arbitrary deadline  Seniors need more time to examine the multitude of prescription drug plans to determine which will best suit their medical needs  The fact that so many have not signed up yet is a strong indication that the program is flawed   said Congressman Payne        About 360 000 New Jerseyans who are eligible for a Medicare drug plan have not yet enrolled  If they don t sign up before Monday s deadline they would have to wait six months to join    and would then have to pay a penalty every month on top of the regular premiums for the drug coverage for the rest of their lives       The Republican controlled Congress has refused to pass legislation supported by Lautenberg  Menendez  Pallone and Payne to extend the deadline to December 31  2006    exactly one year after the new Medicare prescription drug law went into effect       A copy of the letter to Secretary Leavitt is attached       May 12  2006      The Honorable Michael O  Leavitt Secretary of Health and Human Services Department of Health and Human Services 200 Independence Avenue  S W  Washington  DC 20201      Dear Secretary Leavitt       We are writing to strongly urge you to extend the Medicare Part D enrollment deadline until the end of the year  Unless this action is taken  any seniors seeking to enroll in a drug plan after Monday will be forced to wait until November to sign up        At last count in New Jersey  approximately 360 000 individuals who are eligible for Medicare prescription drug coverage have not yet elected to join a specific plan  We are extremely concerned that these individuals will be denied the opportunity to enroll in a drug plan for the next six months and that if they choose to enroll at a later date they will incur a life time penalty        Unfortunately  many seniors and individuals with disabilities have had difficulty in choosing a plan because they are confused about the new benefit  Medicare beneficiaries face an overwhelming number of prescription drug plan options  and choosing the right plan can be a challenge  In New Jersey there are 19 providers offering 45 prescription drug plans  The monthly premiums  deductibles  co payments and formulary for each of these plans differs making the process of selecting a plan difficult and time consuming        While we are disappointed that the Republican Leadership in Congress refused to support an extension of this deadline  their refusal does not stop the Administration from taking unilateral action       Just last month  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  announced that the agency would allow some low income Medicare beneficiaries additional time to enroll in the prescription drug benefit without financial penalty  We believe the same legal authority used to extend the deadline and waive the penalty for low income seniors can be applied in this case        We respectfully urge you to announce your intention to delay both the enrollment deadline and penalty as soon as possible  We want to prevent our constituents from making rushed health care choices that may harm them in the future       Thank you for your attention to this important matter        Sincerely       FRANK R  LAUTENBERG ROBERT MENENDEZ      FRANK PALLONE  JR  DONALD M  PAYNE                     Questions or Comments

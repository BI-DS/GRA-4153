                                                                                Senator Says New Rail Tunnel Needed To Meet Region s Increasing Demand  for Commuter Rail Service  Grow Economy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Contact  Michael Pagan  202  228 6393 Tuesday  March 13  2007        NEWARK  NJ   U S  Senator Frank R  Lautenberg today submitted testimony urging support for the Trans Hudson Express Tunnel project  THE Tunnel  at a New Jersey Transit public hearing          In a prepared statement  Lautenberg noted how the project would  double commuter rail capacity under the Hudson River  allow more New Jersey and New York residents to commute by rail  and improve our environment  regional economy  and overall quality of life           Lautenberg s letter outlined how the rail plan would reduce highway congestion on New Jersey roadways and increase economic development throughout the Metropolitan region           THE Tunnel can help alleviate traffic on our highways and roads by eliminating 35 000 vehicles every day  More trains means more jobs and further economic development  Construction of THE Tunnel will create 6 000 new construction jobs each year and  when completed  44 000 permanent jobs  By building THE Tunnel  we will add  5 billion to New Jersey s Gross Regional Product and  2 billion in real personal income          Last week  Lautenberg announced that THE Tunnel received  16 million in federal funds  Lautenberg has continually secured federal funding for the project since 1999   He has made THE Tunnel a top priority since his return to the appropriations committee         Over the past 20 years  daily commuter rail trips between New Jersey and New York City have doubled  but the demand is hitting a bottleneck in the current 100 year old  two track passenger tunnel under the Hudson River             The proposed tunnel is part of a 5 mile rail line extension project from the Frank R  Lautenberg Rail Station at Secaucus  NJ  under the Hudson River to the planned Daniel Patrick Moynihan Station in Midtown Manhattan   The existing tunnels are being used at capacity during peak hours  running 23 trains per hour   The existing tunnels also represent the biggest chokepoint on the Northern New Jersey rail network as well as the entire Northeast Rail Corridor from Boston  MA  to Washington  DC              A copy of the Lautenberg letter is attached         March 13  2007        Tom Schulze  NJ TRANSIT ARC Project Director  One Penn Plaza East  4th Floor  Newark  NJ 07105        Dear Mr  Schulz          I write in regard to the review of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement for the Trans Hudson Express Tunnel project   THE Tunnel     This project will have a major impact on the entire New Jersey New York region   It will double commuter rail capacity under the Hudson River  allow more New Jersey and New York residents to commute by rail  and improve our environment  regional economy  and overall quality of life         As you know  the entire NJ TRANSIT commuter rail network and Amtrak s Northeast Corridor both narrow down into a 100 year old stretch of track that runs from the Frank R  Lautenberg Station in Secaucus   The track then runs under the Hudson River and into Penn Station New York   We must expand that bottleneck if we want to have a 21st Century rail system or if an emergency requires the evacuation of Manhattan        We must also expand that bottleneck if we want to reduce highway congestion   THE Tunnel can help alleviate traffic on our highways and roads by eliminating 35 000 vehicles every day           More trains mean more jobs and further economic development   Construction of THE Tunnel will create 6 000 new construction jobs each year and  when completed  44 000 permanent jobs   By building THE Tunnel  we will add  5 billion to New Jersey s Gross Regional Product and  2 billion in real personal income         We know that people want to travel by commuter rail as NJ TRANSIT ridership at Penn Station New York has increased 400 percent in 25 years  to more than 40 million trips in 2006   Ultimately  it will result in a better quality of life for tens of thousands of New Jerseyans           We have to protect our economy  our environment and our regional attractiveness   I have fought hard for and helped fund many significant transportation projects over my 22 years serving New Jersey in the Senate  and have fought for federal funding for THE Tunnel since 1999   I look forward to working with my colleagues in Washington to make sure this critical tunnel project gets built as soon as possible       Sincerely        Frank R  Lautenberg                       Questions or Comments

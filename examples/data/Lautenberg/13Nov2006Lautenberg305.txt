                                                                              Calls Bush Administration Proposal  Threat To Our Environment and Our Economy    Contact  Alex Formuzis  202  224 7340 or Chris Bender   202  224 4858 Monday  November 13  2006      At a public meeting today in Atlantic City  Senator Frank R  Lautenberg  D    N J   issued the following public statement on the federal Draft Environmental Impact Statement for the 5 Year Oil and Gas Leasing Program for 2007    2012  in which the Bush Administration proposes drilling for oil and gas off the coast of Virginia      Let me thank Secretary Kempthorne and Director Burton for their response to the bi partisan request of the New Jersey delegation for a public hearing on the Administration  s proposal to open the outer continental shelf off Virginia  s coast for oil and gas drilling            The coastal members of our delegation oppose this proposal   Drilling off the coast of Virginia poses a direct threat to the environment and economy of New Jersey  Instead of drilling  the Administration should give all of the protected Outer Continental Shelf of the Atlantic Coast permanent protection from offshore oil and gas drilling         I grew up in New Jersey and take great pride in my home state  and am very protective of the things that make New Jersey so great  Right at the top of that list is the Jersey Shore          In the summertime  it  s hard to beat spending a day at one of our beautiful beaches  watching our children and grandchildren play in the surf  Perhaps you like to fish  or stroll along the boardwalk in the evening  You can do it all at the Jersey Shore         Our 127 miles of shoreline are a major economic engine for our state  Tourism in New Jersey is a  30 billion a year industry that supports 400 000 jobs    and 70 percent of all state tourism revenues originate at the shore  When anybody proposes something that could put the shore at risk  I take it very seriously         I also cannot emphasize strongly enough the importance of protecting the sensitive marine areas off the coast of New Jersey  The people of New Jersey do not want pollution from oil and gas rigs marring their beaches and fishing grounds         Drilling poses serious threats to our environment and to our economy  According to the Department of Interior  three million gallons of oil spilled from offshore operations in 73 incidents between 1980 and 1999  That  s an average of about four incidents a year   and more than 40 000 gallons of oil per spill  That is more than enough oil to ruin a beach town  s tourist season for years to come  We simply cannot afford to damage our shorelines  nor the marine life that inhabits our coastal waters         The United States needs new sources of energy  but we have never made the long term commitment to renewable energy that is vital to weaning ourselves off of our addiction to fossil fuels  And the enormous potential for energy conservation and efficiency savings are largely untapped           According to the Union of Concerned Scientists  we could save more than 20 billion barrels of oil over twenty years simply by setting average fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks at 40 miles per gallon         If we better utilize the untapped potential of renewable sources of domestic energy and savings    there will never be a need to drill for oil in our precious coastal waters           Opening up even a single state on the Atlantic coast to offshore drilling simply won  t work  Ocean currents off the coast of one state could easily carry an oil slick to many states  There won  t be any fences to protect neighbors from an oil spill that occurs off the coast of Virginia  And the costs of such a spill could be devastating         In 1988 a bag of medical waste washed up on the Jersey Shore   The incident was widely reported in the media  and we lost one third of our tourism revenue that year         No matter how careful industry might be  and however much the technology of drilling has improved over the years  if our coasts are opened to drilling  there will be oil spills          Our commercial and recreational fishing industries in New Jersey are worth hundreds of millions of dollars  We can  t afford the economic catastrophe of an oil spill reaching our shores   whether the drill rigs are located in the waters off New Jersey or Virginia          I will continue to work with the rest of the New Jersey delegation to prevent oil and gas drilling off the Atlantic Coast   It is the wrong policy for New Jersey and the nation                                Questions or Comments

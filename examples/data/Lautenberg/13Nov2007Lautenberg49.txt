today chaired a Senate Commerce Committee hearing to examine the accuracy of the Federal Trade Commissions  FTC  tar and nicotine cigarette rating system  and the marketing claims of tobacco companies based on these ratings  The New Jersey Senator uncovered a lengthy history of false and deceptive cigarette ratings and marketing methods used by the tobacco industry     Altria  Philip Morris  and R J  Reynolds were called to the hearing but refused to attend    Tobacco companies need to be honest with smokers about tar and nicotine exposure  We learned today that the FTC tobacco ratings system deceives smokers  plain and simple  It is now clear that the tobacco industry has been aware of the inaccuracy of these ratings for more than three decades  said Sen  Lautenberg    At a Commerce Committee hearing chaired by Lautenberg  the FTC raised concerns about its testing methods and admitted that its ratings tend to be relatively poor predictors of tar and nicotine exposure  noting how machine measured tar and nicotine ratings are not an accurate reflection of tar and nicotine intake  A document released at the hearing shows that the tobacco industry had knowledge of the inaccuracy of the ratings since the 1970s    Sen  Lautenberg held this hearing to illustrate how the FTC cigarette testing method is not an accurate measure for rating tar and nicotine in cigarettes and how the tobacco industry used the method to mislead smokers into thinking light and low tar cigarettes are healthier and safer than regular cigarettes     The FTC cigarette testing method uses a smoking machine  a smoking robot that smokes every cigarette exactly the same way to determine the amount of tar and nicotine in each brand of cigarettes  According to this method  some cigarettes appear to deliver lower tar and nicotine than regular cigarettes  These cigarettes are usually described as light and low tar by the tobacco industry    However  when smoked by actual smokers  light and low tar cigarettes often cause the smoker to receive more tar and nicotine than regular cigarettes  This is because light cigarette smokers take longer  deeper puffs and smoke more cigarettes a day to compensate for the lower nicotine in these cigarettes     As early as 1975  the tobacco industry knew that light cigarettes did not actually deliver less tar and nicotine to smokers despite the lower ratings from the FTC Cigarette Testing Method  Despite knowing this  the tobacco industry continues to market these cigarettes as healthier and safer than regular cigarettes     Many smokers switch to cigarette brands advertised as low tar or light out of concerns for their health  believing them to be less risky or a step toward quitting  Due to the misleading and deceptive marketing of light cigarettes by the tobacco industry  some light cigarette smokers have filed state lawsuits asserting that the companies committed fraud when they misled consumers into believing that light cigarettes contained less tar and nicotine even though they knew this was false     The following participants testified at todays hearing    William Kovacic  Commissioner  Federal Trade Commission     Cathy

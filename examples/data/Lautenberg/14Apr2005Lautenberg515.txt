     Senator Frank R  Lautenberg                                                                                                                      Press Release        of        Senator Lautenberg                                                                                Lawmakers Introduce Legislation to Ensure Pharmacies Fill ALL Dr  Prescriptions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   A Number of Pharmacists Have Recently Refused to Fill Prescriptions Due to Religious or Moral Beliefs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Thursday  April 14  2005      WASHINGTON  DC       During an outdoor rally today on Capitol Hill  United States Senator Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ   Representatives Carolyn Maloney  D NY   Debbie Wasserman Schwartz  DFL  and other lawmakers and supporters introduced legislation to STOP pharmacies from denying the sale of physician prescribed prescription medications because of their employees religious beliefs        A number of women around the country have recently been denied important family planning prescriptions by individual pharmacists who were personally against them  Representatives from NARAL Pro Choice America  Planned Parenthood of America and the National Women s Law Center also spoke during the event       Recent news reports have documented pharmacists with particular religious or individual beliefs refusing to fill prescriptions for birth control  Now there is action in both the U S  Senate and House to guarantee that every customer will have their legal prescriptions filled   including women who have prescriptions for birth control  The Access to Legal Pharmaceuticals Act  ALPhA  would protect the right of individual pharmacists to refuse to fill a prescription  but would also ensure that pharmacies will fill all prescriptions  even if it a different pharmacist has to do it       Individual pharmacists across the country have refused to fill prescriptions for birth control and have even refused to return prescription slips to customers  One woman in Texas who was a victim of rape was prescribed the Morning After pill by her physician  but later denied the prescription by a pharmacist        A pharmacist s personal beliefs should not come between a patient and their doctor   said Senator Lautenberg   Tomorrow it might be painkillers for a cancer patient  Next year it could be medicine that prolongs the life of a person with AIDS or some other terminal disease         Around the country  women are walking into pharmacies with legal prescriptions to be filled and walking out with nothing  That s not what should happen when you go to a drug store   said Maloney   If a doctor gives you a legal prescription  no one should be able to stop you from getting it filled   it s as simple as that  Access to birth control is a women s heath issue and a private matter  not to be tampered with by a pharmacist with an agenda         Make no mistake about this  the refusal to fill birth control prescriptions targets women and their choice of contraception  not men s   said Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz   I have no doubt that if pharmacists were refusing to sell men condoms that this issue would have already been addressed legislatively  Our legislation will require the pharmacies  the businesses employing the pharmacists  to provide a woman with access to legal forms of birth control         Pharmacists are health professionals whom we trust to fulfill their professional responsibilities to their patients   said Congressman Shays   It is unacceptable for a pharmacist to withhold any safe  legal medication and it is time to put an end to this abuse of trust         Today Senator Lautenberg  Congresswoman Maloney and Congressman Shays sent a clear message that the basic health care needs of women are a priority   said Planned Parenthood Federation of America Interim President  Karen Pearl   A pharmacy s policies cannot intrude on the relationship between a woman and her doctor  A pharmacy must dispense prescriptions issued by health care providers otherwise the patients  health is unnecessarily put at risk         Senator Lautenberg and Representative Maloney are standing up for common sense and personal responsibility against the growing movement urging pharmacists to impose far right ideology on American women  It ought to be simple  walk into a pharmacy with a birth control prescription and walk out with birth control    without intimidation  without inconvenience  and without delay  Pharmacies have an ethical and legal obligation not to endanger women s health by withholding basic health care  Like most Americans  Senator Lautenberg  Representative Maloney and Representative Wasserman Shultz understand that personal responsibility and timely access to birth control prevents unintended pregnancies and therefore reduces the need for abortion   said Nancy Keenan  president of NARAL Pro Choice America        Personal beliefs should never stand in the way of access to basic health care   said Judy Waxman  VP of Health and Reproductive Rights at the National Women s Law Center   This bill would ensure that every woman can walk into her local pharmacy with a valid prescription and leave with her medication in hand and her dignity in tact        ALPhA has been introduced today in the Senate by Senator Frank Lautenberg  D NJ  and in the House by Reps  Carolyn Maloney  D NY   Christopher Shays

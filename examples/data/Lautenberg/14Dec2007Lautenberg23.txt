bipartisan legislation authored by Sen  Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ  and Sen  Arlen Specter  R PA  to provide justice for victims of state sponsored terrorism by giving them their day in court and helping them pursue the assets of countries that support terrorism  The legislation was included in the final conference version of the FY 2008 Department of Defense Authorization bill  The bill passed the House on Wednesday by a vote of 370 to 49 and now goes to President Bush for his signature   Far too many Americans have suffered at the hands of terrorism  My bill will allow victims of state sponsored terror to have their day in court  It would let victims sue countries and hold those countries accountable  said Sen  Lautenberg     I am pleased to cosponsor this legislation which gives the victims of terrorism and their families the ability to seek legal redress  said Sen  Specter  This bill reaffirms that the United States will not tolerate state sponsored terrorism   The legislation would amend the Foreign Services Immunities Act by allowing victims of state sponsored terror to sue countries that support and promote terrorism  The measure also would allow these victims to seize hidden commercial assets for compensation if they win judgments in court    This legislation is important to the families of the victims of the 1983 Marine Barracks bombing in Beirut  Lebanon  It will hold the government of Iran accountable for the murder of 241 men in this bombing  one of whom was my brother  Captain Vincent L  Smith  United States Marine Corps   The injustice of this over the long years has been a heavy burden    the Iranian government has literally been getting away with murder for almost 24 years  The passage of this bill will bring justice by holding the criminals accountable for their crime  And I believe it will mitigate future terrorism  This bill is a huge statement of support for victims of terrorism  and a powerful way to fight terrorism without the use of military force  said Lynn Derbyshire  who serves as the national spokesperson for The Beirut Families   The legislation also was introduced as a bill    the Justice for Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Act  S 1944   and is based on a 1996 amendment to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act known as the Flatow Amendment  which enabled American victims of terrorism to pursue state sponsors of terrorism in court The billwould     reaffirm the rights of plaintiffs to sue state sponsors of terrorism       allow the seizure of hidden commercial assets belonging to terrorist states so victims of terrorism can be justly compensated      limit the number of appeals that a terrorist state can pursue in U S  courts      provide foreign nationals working for the U S  government these same benefits if they are victimized in a terrorist attack during their official duties  and     Limit the number of appeals that the terror state can pursue in U S  courts       U S  District Court ruled in September that Iran owed the families of the 1983 bombing of the Beirut Marine Barracks  which killed 241 servicemen   2 656 billion in damages for this attack  This legislation will enable these victims of terrorism to receive justice and obtain these damages   The original bill has an impressive bipartisan list of 30 cosponsors  including Senators Robert Menendez  D NJ   Trent Lott  R MS   Joseph Biden  D DE   John Cornyn  R TX    Hillary Clinton  D NY  Lindsey Graham  R SC   Diane Feinstein  D CA   Joseph Lieberman  I CT   Charles Schumer  D NY   Norm Coleman  R MN   Robert Casey

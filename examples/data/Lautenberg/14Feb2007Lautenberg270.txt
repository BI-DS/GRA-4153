     Senator Frank R  Lautenberg                                                                                                                      Press Release        of        Senator Lautenberg                                                                                Lautenberg  Pallone  Solis Introduce Bill to Reverse EPA Changes in Toxic Reporting Requirements                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Wednesday  February 14  2007        Washington  D C      U S  Senator Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ  and U S  Reps  Frank Pallone  Jr   D NJ  and Hilda L  Solis  D CA today introduced companion bills in their respected chambers that will undo U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  regulations weakening toxic reporting requirements that have been in place nearly two decades   They announced the legislation at a news conference today on Capitol Hill       In December 2006  the EPA announced final rules that loosen reporting requirements for the Toxics Release Inventory  TRI    With these rules  the Bush administration has undermined this critical program by  eliminating detailed reports from more than 5 000 facilities that release up to 2 000 pounds of chemicals every year  and eliminating detailed reports from nearly 2 000 facilities that manage up to 500 pounds of chemicals known to pose some of the worst threats to human health  including lead and mercury        The Toxic Right to Know Protection Act codifies the stronger reporting requirements that were in place before the Bush administration weakened them late last year   By codifying these requirements  neither the current administration nor future administrations could again change the guidelines without the approval of Congress             In 1986  I wrote the law creating the EPA s Public Right to Know program  which provides Americans with information about toxic chemicals stored and released in their communities  In 1990  I expanded the program to provide the public with even more information  but last December  President Bush s EPA weakened the rules to let companies report less  and tell the public less   In other words   it was a gift to the chemical industry  That s wrong   said Lautenberg   People have a right to know about the toxic chemicals bordering their backyards  and we are here to restore that right            The Toxics Release Inventory program is based on the simple idea that communities have the right to know what toxic chemicals are being dumped in their backyards   It has also been a great tool in getting plants to voluntarily reduce their chemical releases   Pallone said    Last year  we repeatedly tried to show the Bush administration how important this program is  but once again they sided with corporate polluters over the health of the American people   Our legislation reverses this ill advised action                While communities of color make up 32 percent of the U S  population as a whole  they make up nearly 44 percent of the population within one mile of the polluting facilities that would have fewer protections and less information of toxic chemicals as a result of the Administration s proposal  As a result of the Administration action  Californians will lose information from nearly 300 polluting facilities  including many in Los Angeles and the San Gabriel Valley   Solis said   Our message to the Bush Administration is simple   minority and low income communities deserve adequate protection  not a cold shoulder  The legislation we are introducing today is a valuable step toward protecting the health and welfare of these minority and low income communities and I look forward to its consideration          TRI was authored by Lautenberg and passed into law in 1986 as part of the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act  EPCRA  in 1986 after a tragic disaster at a Union Carbide facility in Bhopal  India killed thousands of people   Congress passed EPCRA to ensure that communities know how much of the most dangerous industrial chemicals are being released into the air  water and the ground           Scientists have developed a large body of evidence indicating that exposure to industrial chemicals is widespread among Americans   A study by the Centers for Disease Control  CDC  found over 100 chemicals present in blood and urine samples of average Americans   Furthermore  a National Academies of Science panel found that 25 percent of developmental and neurological problems in children were due to the interplay between exposure to chemicals and genetic factors  and a full 3 percent of the problems were due to chemical exposure alone         Lautenberg s legislation is co sponsored by the Chairman of the Senate Environment and Pubic Works Committee  United States Senator Barbara Boxer along with his colleague Senator Robert Menendez                        Questions or Comments

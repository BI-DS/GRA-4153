Lautenberg  D NJ  and Sen  Jim Webb  D VA  received bicameral support today with Congressman Bobby Scotts introduction of the bill in the House of Representatives  The Post 9 11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2007 seeks to provide veterans of the 9 11 era with educational benefits similar to those provided to service members at the end of World War II   Sens  Lautenberg and Webb  Reps  Chris Carney and John Salazar  and representatives from the Veterans of Foreign Wars  VFW   Vietnam Veterans of America  VVA   the Air Force Sergeants Association  AFSA   the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States  EANGUS  and the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America  IAVA  expressed their support for the bill at a press conference today in the Capitol    Senator Lautenberg  a WWII veteran attended college on the GI Bill   The G I  Bill provided a true opportunity for me  as it has for millions of Americans  Sen  Lautenberg said  After my military service ended  it gave me the education I needed to succeed in business and in the public sector  Now we have a new generation of veterans who selflessly served our country  and we owe them that same opportunity to achieve their dreams   With many of our service members having served under difficult conditions in Iraq and Afghanistan and some of them having pulled multiple tours  it is past time to enact a new veterans education program modeled on the World War II era GI bill  said Sen  Webb  Since I introduced S 22 on January 4  the bill has received strong support from the nations top veterans organizations  18 members of the Senate  and now  5 new members of the House  I applaud Congressman Scott for leading the effort in the House of Representatives   I am proud to be the House sponsor of Senator Webbs Post 9 11 G I  Bill  said Rep  Scott  MA National Guard and U S  Army Reserve  The United States has an obligation to provide our service men and women fighting overseas with the benefits they so rightly deserve  This means we must support our troops while they are overseas and also when they return home and attempt to better their lives through education  It is time for a new G I  bill   Under the legislation  S 22 in the Senate  H R 2702 in the House   returning service members could earn up to 36 months of benefits  equivalent to four academic years  which would include payment of tuition  books and fees  as well as a  1 000 a month living stipend for those veterans whose military service qualifies them for the program   The bill will be brought up for consideration in a hearing of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs scheduled for July 25th  The bill is expected for a mark up this summer    In addition to Sen  Lautenberg and Sen  Webb  Sens  Baucus  Bingaman  Boxer  Brown  Casey  Clinton  Durbin  Harkin  Kerry  Landrieu  McCaskill  Mikulski  Sanders  Stabenow  Tester  and Wyden  and Reps  Boucher  Carney  Moran  Salazar  and Scott are co sponsors of the legislation    As someone who has served our country  I can tell you that the current Montgomery GI Bill is not adequate  This is a peacetime bill  and we must expand it to accommodate our men and women returning from overseas  There is no better way to support our troops than to ensure that they re acclimate into daily life seamlessly and that they have a bright future ahead of them  A comprehensive GI bill  like the one we are introducing today  is a way to achieve this  said Rep  Christopher P  Carney  who serves as a Lt  Commander in the U S  Navy Reserve   The Post 9 11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2007 has been endorsed by the Veterans of Foreign Wars  VFW   Vietnam Veterans of America  VVA   the Air Force Sergeants Association  AFSA   the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States  EANGUS   the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America  IAVA   and the American Association of Community Colleges  AACC     Once an enlistment enticement  educational assistance has now become a transition necessity  This legislation is the right thing to do for those who are willing to take up arms and defend this great nation  something less than one percent of Americans are willing to do  saidFrank Yoakum  SGM  ret   Legislative Director  Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States  EANGUS    Education is an expensive endeavor  many veterans can not afford to use the current GI Bill  The measure proposed by Senator Webb and Congressman Scott is an investment in our troops  an investment in our veterans  and an investment in our nation  said Eric Hilleman  Deputy Director of Legislative  Veterans of Foreign Wars VFW                          Questions or Comments

                                                                              Senate Last Week Approved Lautenberg Amendment to Pull Security Clearances

                                                                               Monday  November 14  2005      WASHINGTON  DC    Following the Senate s adoption last week of the Lautenberg Amendment to strip the security clearance of anyone who knowingly reveals classified information  a group of Senators today called on the White House Security Officer to reevaluate Karl Rove s security clearance  In addition to Lautenberg  Senators Richard Durbin  D IL   Jack Reed  D RI   Tom Harkin  D IA  and Mark Dayton  D MN  also signed the letter       During debate last Thursday on the Defense Authorization bill  the Senate adopted an amendment by U S  Senator Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ  to revoke the security clearance of anyone who knowingly reveals classified information vital to the national security of the United States  including the identity of a covert intelligence agent   In order to avoid a roll call vote on the amendment  Republicans opted for a rare device known as a  Standing Division  to approve the measure        Lautenberg and other Senators sent a letter today seeking confirmation from Mark Frownfelter  the official in charge of security clearances for White House officials  that he is investigating and reevaluating the security clearances of Karl Rove and other Administration officials referenced in the indictment of former Cheney Chief of Staff I  Lewis  Scooter  Libby  Under Federal rules cited in the Senators  letter  upon learning of  adverse information  regarding handling of classified information  Mr  Frownfelter is required to take  prompt action to investigate alleged violations of security  and recommen d  appropriate administrative action with respect to violators         The Senate affirmed the view anyone who reveals the identity of a covert agent should be stripped of their security clearance   said Senator Lautenberg   Yet Karl Rove still has access to some of the most sensitive classified information vital to this nation s national security  If Karl Rove blew the cover of a CIA agent  he should not be in the position to do it again  His clearance should be stripped   A copy of the letter is attached to this release       November 14  2005      Mark Frownfelter Security Officer Executive Office of the President 725 17th Street  NW  Rm  4101 Washington  DC 20503      Dear Mr  Frownfelter       We are writing to seek your assurance that you are treating information disclosed in the indictment of I  Lewis Libby  a k a   Scooter Libby   in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia as an adverse information report on Karl C  Rove  Deputy Chief of Staff to the President of the United States  thereby invoking the appropriate investigation and reevaluation of Mr  Rove s security clearances        According to the above referenced indictment  a White House official identified as  Official A  disclosed the identity of an undercover CIA agent to columnist Robert Novak  who published the information  White House officials have confirmed that  Official A  is Mr  Rove        As you know  such activity is prohibited under Federal regulations governing access to classified information       Classified information may be made available to a person only when the possessor of the information establishes that the person has a valid  need to know  and the access is essential to the accomplishment of official government duties  The proposed recipient is eligible to receive classified information only after he she has been granted a security clearance by the EOP Security Officer        As EOP Security Officer  when the possibility of a violation of these standards becomes evident  you are required to take  prompt action to investigate alleged violations of security  and recommen d  appropriate administrative action with respect to violators         The actions described in the indictment led to the publication of the name of a CIA operative whose employment status was classified  This revelation of classified information damaged national security by destroying an operative s covert cover  compromising intelligence gathering operations  and endangering the safety of other CIA employees and their contacts        In addition to Mr  Rove  the indictment raises concerns about whether other current and former White House officials mishandled classified information  Among the persons that appear to be referenced  by title  in the indictment are David Addington  who served as  Counsel to the Vice President  at the time of the indictment  and has since been promoted to replace Mr  Libby as Chief of Staff  and Eric Edelman  the  then Principal Deputy  to Mr  Libby  who has left the Vice President s office and is currently the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy        We would like your assurance that you are taking prompt action on this case  and that you will follow up with appropriate administrative actions regarding these officials  access to classified information       We look forward to hearing from you       Sincerely       FRANK R  LAUTENBERG RICHARD J  DURBIN      JACK REED TOM HARKIN      MARK DAYTON

     Senator Frank R  Lautenberg                                                                                                                      Press Release        of        Senator Lautenberg                                                                                Lautenberg Introduces Legislation to Prevent Partisan Activity By Election Officials                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Tuesday  February 15  2005      WASHINGTON  DC    Today  United States Senator Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ  introduced legislation to ensure that State officials in charge of supervising the certification of votes for federal elections are not also affiliated with the campaigns of those persons running for federal office  In the last two presidential elections  the Secretaries of State of Florida  Katherine Harris  and Ohio  Ken Blackwell  were not only in charge of certifying the votes of their respective states  but were also the Chairs of the Bush Cheney 00  and 04  campaigns respectively  Senators John Kerry  D MA   Barbara Boxer  D CA  and Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  are co sponsors of Lautenberg s bill        Allowing a state official to oversee a federal election while serving as a campaign official for one of the candidates in that election is a blatant conflict of interest   said Lautenberg       Senator Lautenberg s Federal Election Integrity Act  FEIA  of 2005  to be introduced today  would prohibit Secretaries of State and other chief state election officials with supervisory authority over the administration of federal elections from participating in the political campaign or management of a candidate running for federal office in their state  The Secretary of State is the chief election official in 39 States  Congressman Ted Strickland  D OH  introduced similar legislation in the House today       Congress has the right to set the rules for fair Federal elections  Thus  Senator Lautenberg s bill does not affect state elections  but only elections for Federal offices  such as President  Vice President  U S  Senator and U S  Representative        Those officials in charge of certifying federal elections must not be allowed to serve two masters  The will of the voters must come before the personal politics of those who oversee elections   said Lautenberg        In order to maintain America s stature and the legitimacy of our electoral system  we must remove the perception that election regulators could make partisan decisions regarding access to polls and other election processes  This legislation will go a long way toward making that a reality   said Congressman Strickland       A fact sheet of Sen  Lautenberg s legislation is attached to this release       FEDERAL ELECTION INTEGRITY ACT OF 2005 To be introduced by Senators Lautenberg  Kerry  Boxer and Clinton       Senator Lautenberg s Federal Election Integrity Act  FEIA  of 2005 would prohibit Secretaries of State and other chief state election officials with direct supervisory authority over the administration and certification of Federal elections from participating in the political campaign or management of a candidate running for Federal office in their state  Amending the Federal Campaign Act of 1971  the FEIA creates a direct prohibition on State election officials from taking part in political campaigns and provides for an expedited complaint review process at the Federal Elections Commission        This is not a Democratic or Republican issue  Rather  this is an issue that concerns the preservation of the American people s faith and confidence in the election process  Simply put  an election official responsible for ensuring fair and accurate federal elections should not be connected with any of the candidates in that election       Conflict of Interest      There is an inherent conflict of interest when an election official charged with supervising the administration of an election and ensuring the fairness and accuracy of the results has a direct role in the campaign of one of the candidates running for Federal office        In the 2004 Presidential election  Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell was co chairman of Bush Cheney  04 in Ohio  On December 6th  2004  Blackwell certified President Bush as the winner in Ohio        This is the second presidential election that presented such a conflict of interest in a critical state  In the 2000 election  Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris served as co chair of President Bush s Florida campaign  President Bush s narrow victory in Florida gave President Bush the state s 25 electoral votes necessary to win the presidency       Authority      Congress has the authority to set the rules for fair Federal elections  Thus  Senator Lautenberg s bill does not affect state elections  but only elections for Federal offices  such as President  Vice President  U S  Senator and U S  Representative                      Questions or Comments

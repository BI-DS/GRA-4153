                                                                              Lautenberg  Health Advocates and Doctors Urge CDC Panel to Issue Strong Recommendation on New Vaccine that Prevents Cervical Cancer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Vaccine Could Save Thousands of Lives  But Some Oppose Widespread Use for Ideological Reasons   Contact  Alex Formuzis  202  224 7340 Friday  June 16  2006      HACKENSACK  N J     United States Senator Frank R  Lautenberg today was joined by physicians and public health advocates in urging the Centers for Disease Control  CDC  to ignore calls from some conservative groups and strongly recommend widespread vaccination          The Food and Drug Administration  FDA  recently approved Gardasil  a vaccine against the human papilloma virus  HPV  which causes 70 percent of cervical cancer cases           Cervical cancer is the second most prevalent cancer killer among women worldwide  killing about 233 000 each year including almost 4 000 in the United States  If this vaccine were given to every girl and young woman  many of these lives would be saved           Today I am calling on the CDC to base their recommendation about who should be vaccinated on science and not on ideology     said Senator Lautenberg    Thousands of lives could be saved each year if as many girls and young woman as possible could get access to this groundbreaking vaccine  This issue is about public health    ideology should have no place in the CDC  s discussions over this new vaccine            The Centers for Disease Control  CDC  Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices  ACIP  will soon decide whether to recommend widespread vaccination with Gardasil  As the only entity in the federal government which makes such recommendations  ACIP  s decision will set the standard by which states determine coverage of the vaccination  insurance companies choose to cover the cost  and doctors decide how to advise their patients          Ultraconservative organizations such as Focus on the Family and the Abstinence Clearinghouse have indicated they do not support routine vaccinations with Gardasil   Dr  Reginald Finger  a former employee at Focus on the Family and now a member of the CDC advisory panel  expressed concerns that if  people begin to market the  HPV  vaccine or tout the vaccine that this makes adolescent sex safer  then that would undermine the abstinence only message            I urge the ACIP to make its recommendation as you have always done  based solely on science and public heath policy     wrote Senator Lautenberg in his letter to Dr  Jon S  Abramson  Chairman of the ACIP   A copy of the letter is attached to this release         June 16  2006      Jon S  Abramson  M D   Chairman      Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices  Department of Health and Human Services  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention       1600 Clifton Road  NE  Atlanta  Georgia 30333       Dear Dr  Abramson       I was pleased to learn that the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  recently approved Gardasil  a vaccine against the human papilloma virus  HPV  for use in females 9 26 years of age   The rapid approval of Gardasil by the FDA marks a major advancement toward protecting women  s health           As you know  cervical cancer is the second most prevalent cancer killer among women worldwide   Across the globe cervical cancer affects an estimated 470 000 women and kills approximately 233 000 each year   In the United States  the disease strikes nearly 10 000 and kills nearly 4 000 each year   This vaccine will be nothing short of a lifesaver for countless women          The Centers for Disease Control  CDC  Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices  ACIP  which you chair will soon decide whether to recommend routine vaccination with Gardasil   As the only entity in the federal government which makes such recommendations  your committee  s decision will set the standard by which states determine coverage of the vaccination  insurance companies choose to cover the cost  and doctors decide how to advise their patients          However  as you know  politically powerful  special interest groups are calling on policy makers to ignore the science and public health benefits of this vaccine  and base vaccination policy on religious based ideology   I urge the ACIP to make its recommendation as you have always done  based solely on science and in the interest of good public heath policy         I thank you for your consideration of this request and look forward to working with you to make sure that all Americans have access to the best disease protections available        Sincerely        Frank Lautenberg                   Questions or Comments

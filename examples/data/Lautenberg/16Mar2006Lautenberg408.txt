     Senator Frank R  Lautenberg                                                                                                                      Press Release        of        Senator Lautenberg                                                                                Lawmakers Seek Rotunda Honors for Fallen U S  Soldiers as Nation Marks Three Year Anniversary of Iraq Invasion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Thursday  March 16  2006      WASHINGTON  DC    In a letter to the Speaker of the House and the Senate Majority Leader  Senator Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ  and Congressman Rahm Emanuel  D IL  called for a temporary memorial to be displayed in the Capitol Rotunda honoring U S  soldiers who lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan  The lawmakers make their request as the country approaches the three year anniversary of the U S  invasion of Iraq         As our nation approaches the third anniversary of the war in Iraq  we are writing to ask for your assistance in establishing a temporary memorial in the Capitol Rotunda to honor the 2 596 Americans who have sacrificed their lives while serving our country in Afghanistan and Iraq  We request that this memorial be set up from Memorial Day through July 4  2006   wrote Lautenberg and Emanuel in their letter to their respective congressional leaders        Lautenberg and Emanuel attempted in September 2004 to create a memorial in the Capitol to honor those who have lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan  but their request was not granted  Since then  both of the lawmakers have displayed the names and photographs of fallen soldiers outside their personal offices        It is time for Congress to honor every soldier who has made the ultimate sacrifice in Iraq and Afghanistan   said Senator Lautenberg   A memorial in the Capitol will give thousands of visitors every day an opportunity to pause for a minute and look at the faces and read the names of those brave men and women who have given their lives for their country         We invoke the sacrifices of our fallen in the abstract  but we never take the time to honor them individually   Emanuel said   Congress has a responsibility to let the families of these heroes know that their sacrifice will always be remembered by a grateful nation        Next week  March 20th  will mark the third anniversary of the invasion by coalition forces of Iraq  Since then  more than 2 500 American soldiers have been killed serving their country        A copy of the letter is attached to this release       March 16  2006      The Honorable J  Dennis Hastert Senator William H  Frist Speaker of the House of Representatives Senate Majority Leader Room H232  U S  Capitol Room S230  U S  Capitol Washington  DC 20515 Washington  DC 20510       Dear Mr  Speaker and Majority Leader Frist       As our nation approaches the third anniversary of the conflict in Iraq  we are writing to ask for your assistance in establishing a temporary memorial in the Capitol Rotunda to honor the 2 596 Americans who have sacrificed their lives while serving our country in Afghanistan and Iraq  We request that this memorial be set up from Memorial Day through July 4  2006       The time has come for the House and Senate to join in a bipartisan  bicameral tribute in the Capitol Rotunda to our brave men and women  The Rotunda has been the site of many solemn remembrances  including the recent lying in honor of Rosa Parks and the upcoming Holocaust memorial ceremony  Veterans such as Douglas MacArthur  Dwight Eisenhower  and John F  Kennedy  as well as the unknown soldiers of World War I  World War II  Korea and Vietnam  have lain in state in this sacred chamber  Honoring the fallen of Iraq and Afghanistan in this setting is equally appropriate  In the words of Franklin D  Roosevelt  each of these heroes  stands in the unbroken line of patriots who have dared to die that freedom might live        Both chambers recently participated in moving  bipartisan tributes to our fallen troops  On March 2  Congressman Steve Buyer asked for a moment of silence on the House floor in honor of the family of the late Army Sergeant Ricky Jones  and all families who have lost loved ones in the name of freedom  Every Member participated  On December 16  Senator Lautenberg introduced S Res 338  honoring each of the fallen by name  and the resolution passed unanimously with every Senator signing on as a cosponsor  And last July  21 Members participated in a bipartisan reading of the names of the fallen on the House floor        A temporary memorial in the Capitol Rotunda will demonstrate the support of the full Congress for those families to whom we owe a debt that can never be fully repaid  It will also provide the thousands of people who visit the Capitol every day with an opportunity to honor those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for their country       Thank you for your consideration of this request  We look forward to working with your offices to honor our fallen heroes and their families       Sincerely       Frank R  Lautenberg Rahm Emanuel

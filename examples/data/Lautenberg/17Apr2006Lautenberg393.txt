States Senators Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ  and Robert Menendez  D NJ  laid out steps President Bush can take to lower gas prices for New Jersey drivers  The two lawmakers were joined by Fort Lee Mayor Jack Alter and Bergen County Executive Dennis McNerney       In a letter sent today  Senators Lautenberg and Menendez accused the President of ignoring the dramatic rise in gas prices and its impact on families in New Jersey and across the country   Under your leadership  a gallon of gasoline has risen from  1 16 per gallon to  2 73 since the end of 2001  This enormous price increase is hitting millions of American families and businesses very hard   wrote the lawmakers       Lautenberg and Menendez called on the President to address the issue of skyrocketing gas prices by taking a series of steps at his disposal  First  take action against OPEC  This year  President Bush refused to make reform of OPEC a condition of Saudi Arabia s accession to the World Trade Organization  WTO  despite the OPEC cartel violating WTO s prohibition on export quotas  Lautenberg and Menendez urged the President to file an official complaint with the WTO against OPEC s illegal actions        Last year  Senator Lautenberg introduced the OPEC Accountability Act  S 752   which requires the President to initiate consultations with OPEC nations that are also members of WTO to seek their elimination of any action that limits the production or distribution of oil  natural gas  or any other petroleum products  If the consultations fail  the legislation requires the U S  Trade Representative to initiate World Trade Organization  WTO  dispute proceedings       The Federal Trade Commission  FTC  is currently conducting an investigation into possible price gouging by big oil companies  If the FTC concludes there were potentially unfair business practices  including price gouging  there are actions that can and must be taken  The lawmakers urged President Bush to call on the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  to use its authority to hold the big oil companies accountable for their actions against American consumers        Mr  President  in your State of the Union address you said keeping America competitive requires affordable energy  As the big oil companies are posting record profits  many families in New Jersey are finding it difficult to balance the costs of filling their tanks with other critical needs of their families  We urge you to address the growing crisis before the summer travel season begins   wrote the lawmakers       Lautenberg Report on OPEC http   www

the end of 2001  This enormous price increase is hitting millions of American families and businesses very hard  We hope you will take the much needed steps outlined below to reduce  or at least  contain  the price of gasoline       We urge you to take immediate action against OPEC by instructing the United States Trade Representative to file a complaint with the World Trade Organization  WTO  against OPEC member nations for violating WTO s prohibition on export quotas  OPEC operates as a cartel  which drives up the price of oil worldwide  This year  you inexplicably refused to make reform of OPEC a condition of Saudi Arabia s accession to the World Trade Organization  WTO   despite the OPEC cartel s harmful impact on the U S  market  You should also know that there is legislation pending in the Senate  the OPEC Accountability Act  S 752   introduced by Senator Lautenberg  which also requires the President to authorize the U S  Trade Representative to initiate World Trade Organization  WTO  dispute proceedings and take appropriate action regarding the violating country under U S  trade remedy laws        Additionally  the Federal Trade Commission s  FTC  report on possible price gouging by the big oil companies in the United States is due later this year  If the FTC concludes there were potentially unfair business practices including price gouging  we urge you to call on the FTC to use its authority to hold the big oil companies accountable for their actions against American consumers       Mr  President  in your State of the Union address you said keeping America competitive requires affordable energy  As the big oil companies are posting record profits  many families in New Jersey are finding it difficult to balance the costs of filling their tanks with other critical needs of their families  We urge you to address the growing crisis before the summer travel season begins       Sincerely       Frank R  Lautenberg Robert Menendez

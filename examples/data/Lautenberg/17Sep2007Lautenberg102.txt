                                                                               Contact  Press Office  202  224 3224 Monday  September 17  2007       NEW YORK CITY     Sen  Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ  and Mayor Michael R  Bloomberg  I NY  today announced the support of members of the bi partisan coalition of Mayors Against Illegal Guns for legislation that will keep guns out of the hands of terrorists    The bill  S  1237   H R  2074  was introduced by Sen  Lautenberg and Rep  Peter King  R NY  and  for the first time  allows the Department of Justice to prohibit known and suspected terrorists from buying a gun  Currently  terror suspects are not prohibited from purchasing firearms  This bill gives the Justice Department the authority to block such purchases    It defies common sense that nothing in our gun laws prevents terror suspects from buying a firearm This  terror gap  in our gun laws has been open too long and my bill will close that gap  said Sen  Lautenberg  D NJ    One of the most glaring mistakes in preventing 9 11 was the governments failure to share information and connect the dots  said Mayor Bloomberg  As you remember  2 of the 19 hijackers were on a terrorist watch list  yet they were allowed to board an airplane  Today  suspected terrorists cannot fly  but they can still buy guns We just cant afford to wait for another attack to take these kinds of basic  common sense precautions   I cant think of a more obvious disqualifying criterion from purchasing a weapon than being listed on a terror watch list  said Rep  King  the ranking member on the House Homeland Security Committee  It is unfathomable to me that we knowingly allow the transfer of firearms to these individuals  Changing this policy should be a no brainer  Our role in Congress is to create laws that protect the American people  not to uphold those that give terrorists the right to bear arms   The Senator and the Mayor were joined by Trenton  New Jersey Mayor and President of the US Conference of Mayors Douglas H  Palmer  Jersey City Mayor Jerremiah Healy  New York City Police Commissioner Raymond W  Kelly and Devorah Halberstam  the mother of Ari Halberstam  who was killed by a terrorist wielding an illegal gun on a Brooklyn Bridge on ramp near the site of todays event   The Lautenberg King Bill Would Close the Terror Gap that Allows Terrorists to Buy Guns  Currently  there are nine factors  such as status as a felon or evidence of serious mental health problems  under Federal law that disqualify an individual from buying a gun  but being a known or suspected terrorist is not one of those factors The government is powerless to stop a gun sale to a terror suspect unless he also meets one of the nine disqualifying factors The Lautenberg   King bill gives the Department of Justice the ability to use terror watch lists to prevent a terror suspect from purchasing a firearm from a licensed dealer  The bill also allows the Department of Justice to prevent known and suspected terrorists from working with explosives and from becoming a federal firearms license  FFL  holder These DOJ determinations would be subject to judicial review and  under the bill  a suspect would have the opportunity to challenge the determination in federal court   Following a request by Sen  Lautenberg  the Government Accountability Office  GAO  found in 2005 that individuals on terrorist watch lists were able to purchase guns at gun stores in the U S  The legislation introduced by Sen  Lautenberg and Rep  King is modeled on a bill drafted by the Department of Justice in response to the GAO report  Since the Lautenberg   King bill has been introduced  the Department of Justice has announced its support for it   Terrorists Have Repeatedly Attempted to Purchase Firearms and Some Terrorists Have Already Attacked Americans Using Firearms   Individuals on various terrorist watch lists have bought guns legally in the past  According to the FBI and the Government Accountability Office  individuals on various terrorist watch lists were able to buy guns from licensed dealers 47 times during a nine month span in 2004 In the New York area alone  terrorists have repeatedly taken lives in attacks using guns   On November 5  1990 in a Manhattan hotel  El Sayed A  Nosair assassinated Rabbi Meir Kahane with a  357 revolver with a defaced serial number Nosair was linked to the perpetrators of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing      On March 1  1994  Rashid Baz  shot and killed 16 year old Ari Halberstam on an on ramp to the Brooklyn Bridge  Baz was armed with a machine gun  a 9 MM pistol  and a street sweeper shotgun      On February 23  1997  Ali Abu Kamal opened fire on the observation deck of the Empire State Building with a handgun purchased in Florida in violation of federal law  killing one tourist and wounding six others before killing himself                          Questions or Comments

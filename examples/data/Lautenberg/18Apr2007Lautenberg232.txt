 and Congressman Jim Saxton  N J  3rd  have unveiled the bipartisan  Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Act     also called the CELP bill    to advance federal efforts to protect coastal areas from development       In the Senate  Sen  Lautenberg introduced the bill with his colleague  Sen  Judd Gregg  R N H     In the House  Rep  Saxton is the sponsor of the CELP bill  H R  1907  with chief co sponsor Rep  Lois Capps   D Calif          Our legislation would ensure a federal commitment to protect and preserve valuable coastal areas in our state and across the nation   said Senator Frank Lautenberg  a member of the Senate Commerce Committee and Environment and Public Works Committee and one of the Senate s leading environmental advocates    Conserving our coastal areas will help maintain water quality  wildlife habitat  flood protection and recreational opportunities   The protection of New Jersey s treasured natural resources  from the marshlands of Barnegat Bay to the Meadowlands  is vital to the ecological and economic health of our state          Our coasts are being developed at a frightening pace   said Saxton  a senior member of the House Natural Resources Committee who first introduced the bill in 2005  and reintroduced it Wednesday on the House floor   Coastal lands available for preservation are becoming scarce  This bill will provide funding for coastal land acquisition efforts for the next five years  Sen  Lautenberg and I will work to move this through both bodies of Congress and have it signed into law        The legislation provides funds for land acquisition projects that are selected based on the priorities in a state s Coastal Zone Management Plan  Coastal and estuarine land preservation projects that are identified in a management plan  like that for the Barnegat Bay National Estuary Program  are also eligible       The bill would authorize the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  NOAA  to use federal funds to assist land acquisition in fiscal years 2008 through 2012  The federal funds provided through this program would be combined with state  local and private funding  The program would be administered by the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management in the National Ocean Service of the NOAA       The Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge and the Jacques Cousteau National Estuarine Research Reserve  JCNERR   which is operated by Rutgers University at the mouth of the Mullica River in Burlington  Ocean and Atlantic Counties  are examples of entities that could benefit under the bill  The JCNERR has several properties adjacent to its boundaries that merit CELP funding  according to Reserve officials        The current CELP Program  which will be vastly improved by the changes in the legislation introduced by Mr  Saxton and Senator Lautenberg today  is a proven success  having already provided funding for lands within Ocean County   said Sharon McKenna  Assistant Manager of the JCNERR  based in the Great Bay Mullica River watershed   This bill will turn CELP into a competitive program to ensure that critical coastal and estuarine lands under the threat of imminent development here in New Jersey receive acquisition funding        The Trust for Public Land  a land conservation group with offices in Morristown and Southampton  has endorsed the bill        The Trust for Public Land applauds Senator Lautenberg and Representative Saxton for their leadership in conserving our remaining coastal open spaces in New Jersey and across the nation   said Alan Front  Sr  Vice President for The Trust for Public Land   The CELP program has already provided nearly  10 million to help New Jersey s local communities protect vanishing coastal resources and create additional public access to their waterfronts   from Raritan Bay to Barnegat Bay  and we look forward to realizing the benefits of this new legislation to protect more public open space along the Jersey shore         New Jersey s 130 mile coastline includes numerous bays  over 50 miles of barrier islands  multiple rivers and estuaries and the 1 1 million acre National Pinelands Reserve

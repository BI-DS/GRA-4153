Americans  including a number of New Jerseyans  stuck in Lebanon as armed conflict rages  United States Senators Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ  and Robert Menendez  D NJ  urged the Bush administration to more quickly evacuate Americans seeking to leave Lebanon  European citizens in Beirut have largely been evacuated while Americans continue to wait for the U S  to put its plan into effect          It is deeply troubling that  seven days after the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah began  we have evacuated fewer than 200 American citizens  of the 25 000 who live and work in Lebanon   In our view  the U S  State and Defense Departments have not moved quickly enough to evacuate our citizens  and we urge you to redouble your efforts without further delay and immediately present a finalized evacuation plan for the safe evacuation of the 15 000 Americans who have registered a desire to leave Lebanon   wrote the lawmakers                      Italy and France chartered ships and have already have moved some 1 600 Europeans to Cyprus  while Russia has finalized plans to evacuate 1 400 nationals from Lebanon  about 850 Swedes have been evacuated  mostly to Aleppo in northern Syria  and Denmark has evacuated 700 of its 2 300 of its citizens   Currently  fewer than 200 Americans out of 25 000 have been evacuated           It is unfathomable why the U S    with the most sophisticated military in the world   lags behind a number of other countries that have already evacuated hundreds of their citizens   the lawmakers wrote         Lautenberg and Menendez also said the State Department needs to do a better job of responding to citizens with family members in Lebanon  According to press reports  a New Jersey woman with two sons in Lebanon was placed on hold for 45 minutes when she called the State Department s evacuation hotline         A copy of the letters to Secretaries Rice and Rumsfeld are attached to this release       July 18  2006       Condoleezza Rice  Secretary of State  U S  Department of State  2201 C Street  NW  Washington  DC 20520       Dear Madame Secretary         We are writing to express our deep concern about the shockingly slow pace of U S  evacuation efforts of American citizens from Lebanon   It is deeply troubling that  seven days after the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah began  we have evacuated fewer than 200 American citizens  of the 25 000 who live in Lebanon   In our view  the U S  State and Defense Departments have not moved quickly enough to evacuate our citizens  and we urge you to redouble your efforts without further delay and immediately present a finalized evacuation plan for the safe evacuation of the 15 000 Americans who have registered a desire to leave Lebanon         As of this writing  U S  Marine Corps helicopters evacuated approximately 65 Americans from Lebanon this past Sunday  flew another 42 Americans to safety at a British air base in Cyprus yesterday  and shuttled an additional 50 Americans to Cyprus early this morning on a French ship   But this patchwork approach to evacuating American citizens is an inappropriate way to proceed         It is unfathomable why the U S     with the most sophisticated military in the world    lags behind a number of other countries that have already evacuated hundreds of their citizens    We know from the Associated Press and other media outlets  as well as from their Embassies here in Washington  that the following countries have already evacuated hundreds of their citizens from Lebanon  or have at the very least finalized plans to get them out            Italy and France chartered ships and have already have moved some 1 600 Europeans to Cyprus        Russia has finalized plans to evacuate 1 400 nationals from Lebanon        About 850 Swedes have been evacuated  mostly to Aleppo in northern Syria        Denmark has evacuated 700 of its 2 300 of its citizens            Indonesia is evacuating all its nationals  including diplomatic staff and others  to Syria        New Zealand  Japan  and the Philippines are helping their citizens flee the violence  and       Even Thailand has made contingency plans to evacuate 25 000 Thai farm workers in Israel          Again  we are very disturbed about the extremely slow pace of our evacuation efforts of American citizens   We have to do better   We urge you to use all the resources at your disposal to bring our citizens to safety immediately       Sincerely       Frank R  Lautenberg  Robert Menendez        cc  The Secretary of Defense  Donald Rumsfeld

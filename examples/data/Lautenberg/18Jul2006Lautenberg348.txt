                                                                                  Contact  Alex Formuzis  202  224 7340 Tuesday  July 18  2006      WASHINGTON  D C     United States Senator Frank  R  Lautenberg  D NJ  delivered the following remarks from the Senate floor today during consideration of legislation to expand embryonic stem cell research          Mr  President  this is one of those debates that make the American people scratch their head  and ask    what are those people in Washington thinking          From the perspective of everyday people  this should not even be a debate     Of course we should fully fund research with embryonic stem cells    because it has the potential to save the lives and alleviate the suffering of millions of Americans   That  s just common sense  But we have a President who is a captive of ideologues and extremists in his political party        Nearly five years ago  President Bush enacted a policy that made no scientific contribution  only political fodder for his reelection     He put a stop to development of new stem cell lines for research       That was a devastating blow to Americans suffering from diabetes  cancer  Parkinson  s  Alzheimer  s  multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injuries  Mr  President  for many years  I have met with children stricken with Juvenile Diabetes in my office  These children and their parents  brothers  and sisters ask me why the President is not allowing research to move forward that can cure their disease       There is no decent answer I can give them  When I asked them    What the worst thing about living with Diabetes is           They respond plaintively  begging for help so they can stop drawing blood from their fingers    six times a day   They are pleading to live life like other kids   One child said he is forbidden to sleep over his friends   houses because of fright that he will go into insulin shock       I promised these kids I would do everything I can to get the message to the President  so we can get a cure for them   And now  today  we have the opportunity to finally help these kids       It has been over a year since the House passed this bill   Why the delay   There is no comprehensible reason   We can only wonder how many people had their hopes dashed and their spirits broken during that wasted year  Mr  President  Americans in large majorities support stem cell research    so I can  t understand our fiddling while Rome burns        72 percent of Americans favor embryonic stem cells research  while just 24 percent oppose it    a three to one margin  One of the most outspoken supporters of stem cell research is former First Lady Nancy Reagan  who spent ten years watching her husband suffer from Alzheimer  s disease       Virtually every major medical  scientific  and patients   rights group supports embryonic stem cell research        In my home state of New Jersey  support for stem cell research is overwhelming   We were the second state after California to authorize embryonic stem cell research   But unfortunately  President Bush has cut off Federal funding for those projects        Senator Menendez and I recently visited the Coriell Institute in Camden  New Jersey  which was founded in 1953   It holds the world s largest collection of human cells for research  Coriell has everything in place to find cures and help millions of people   But there is one problem   President Bush is undermining their efforts with his irrational policy on stem cell research         Because of the scarcity of embryonic stem cell lines caused by President Bush  s executive order  the Coriell Institute in New Jersey had to go overseas    to the Technion Institute in Israel  to get access to an embryonic stem cell line   He denies hope to millions of people based on his standards of   ethics and morality      But what is ethical about denying a cure to children suffering from Diabetes         What is moral about denying paralyzed people the chance to walk again  Mr  President  any real ethical issues are addressed by this bill   New stem cell lines will come from embryos donated by fertility patients under strict guidelines  There will not be embryos created for research  What we are talking about in this bill are embryos that would otherwise be disposed of    thrown away       I believe compassion and common sense must prevail over rigid ideology  If we pass this bill  I understand that the President intends to veto it   That would be a terrible and tragic mistake       President Bush has never vetoed a bill  In the nearly six years of his presidency   not one veto  What would it say to the American people if his first veto was of a bill that could save millions of lives       And I say to the American people  don  t be fooled by the sleight of hand we are seeing today   There are three bills being considered but only one of them matters   The other two bills are part of a shell game   They are there to give President Bush something to sign  But will those two bills do much to help the American with a shaky hand from being cured of Parkinson  s Disease       Will those two bills make real strides toward relieving a child with Diabetes from the constant shots of insulin  I don  t think so       Only one bill can do that    the House stem cell bill    lets vote to approve it

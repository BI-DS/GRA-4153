                                                                              Lawmakers Announce Bipartisan Emergency Legislation to Reimburse States for Medicare Prescription Costs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Thursday  January 19  2006      WASHINGTON  D C     In response to problems arising from the implementation of the new Medicare drug plan  a bipartisan group of lawmakers led by Senators Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ  and Olympia Snowe  R ME  announced emergency legislation today to reimburse states that have paid millions of dollars for prescriptions for low income and disabled Medicare beneficiaries  Senators Chuck E  Schumer  D NY   Norm Coleman  R MN  and Dianne Feinstein  D CA  will also be original co sponsors of the legislation  The legislation will be introduced tomorrow when the Senate comes back into session  The bill will require the federal government to reimburse States with interest  It also directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to recover any overpayments made by states to private prescription drug plans and return that money to the Medicare Trust Fund        This is a crisis for millions of Americans  The stakes here are life and death  The Federal Government has failed do its job right and the states are left holding the bag   said Lautenberg   Congress needs to pay the states back for bailing the Federal Government out of this mess         Problems with the implementation of the new Medicare drug benefit are occurring nationwide   said Snowe   In Maine  tens of thousands of our most vulnerable seniors would have lost their prescription drug coverage if the state had not stepped in  States around the country should not have to wait to be compensated by insurance companies for expenses incurred as a direct result of CMS  errors  The federal government should live up to its new responsibility and reimburse states for these costs         Schumer said   This Medicare bill is the biggest government fiasco in recent memory  Not only is the Medicare bill confusing  and nearly impossible to navigate  but it s now costing states hundreds of millions of dollars for low income seniors who fell through the bureaucratic cracks  Every kid learns that if you break it  you buy it  And the federal government broke this drug bill big time  The federal government should pay the states back    with interest for their trouble  and that s what this bill will do          I find it inexcusable that six million dual eligible beneficiaries and their community pharmacists have been denied coverage and reimbursement because of a computer glitch with the implementation of the Part D program   said Coleman   I understand the difficulties of this transition but am very thankful that many states  including Minnesota  have stepped up to the plate to make sure these beneficiaries  the low income and disabled  have their prescriptions filled  I have no doubt this responsibility falls on the Federal government and our legislation will help States recoup funds spent during this period         The faulty implementation of the new drug benefit has caused a major health emergency in California and other states across the nation  particularly for seniors with chronic and debilitating diseases who rely on multiple medications every day to keep them alive  Because of severe glitches in the Medicare database  these individuals are leaving pharmacies without their medications or are making undue sacrifices to pay for costs they should not have incurred in the first place   said Senator Feinstein        Currently  25 states have moved to pick up the cost of these prescriptions       A fact sheet of the bill is attached to the press release       MEDICARE STATE REIMBURSEMENT ACT      To be introduced by Senators Lautenberg  D NJ   Snowe  R ME   Schumer  D NY   Coleman  R MN  and Feinstein  D CA       Requires the Federal Government to reimburse the states for the cost of prescriptions for low income seniors and people with disabilities   dual eligibles   who were eligible for coverage under Medicare Part D  but were improperly denied Federal coverage        Will reimburse states through an equivalent reduction in funds owed by each state under the  claw back  provision of the new Medicare law       Reimbursement will be at a rate equal to 100 percent of all State costs plus an interest rate equal to the market rate on 3 month Treasury Securities plus 0 1 percent       Directs the Secretary of HHS to recover overpayments by states to private prescription drug plans and return that money to the Medicare Trust Fund                         Questions or Comments

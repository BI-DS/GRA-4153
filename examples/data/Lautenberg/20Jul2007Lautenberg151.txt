                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Contact  Press Office  202  224 3224 Friday  July 20  2007       The PRESIDING OFFICER  Mr  Cardin   The Senator from New Jersey is recognized     Mr  LAUTENBERG  Mr  President  I am sure that what is taking place on the floor of the Senate must present a terribly confusing picture to the American people  It is hard to understand even being here  with colleagues shouting their support for the American troops while they inject that what they need is an injection of truth serum for the vote  Then it will be plain and simple to see where they are  those who are opposing a direct vote  an up or down  as we call it  to take place  and that will answer the question  Do you want our soldiers  airmen  seamen  and marines returned home  as the American people are demanding  I remind our friends that the obligation is to get our people back to their families as soon as possible     Outside my office  I pay respect to America s lost soldiers  our casualties of war  in a display called the   Faces of the Fallen    It gives a picture and some background of the soldiers who gave their lives in this ill conceived and seemingly endless war in Iraq  Every day  families  friends  and visitors search through thousands of photos looking to see if there are people they know  while they try to comprehend the human cost of this war to parents  spouses  children  siblings  and friends across our country    Four years and four months have passed since President Bush sent young American men and women to fight in a war based on faulty intelligence and incomplete information about an enemy and the scope of this ferocious conflict  Now 160 000 American men and women are mired in a civil war in Iraq  facing thousands of insurgents willing to die themselves while they try to kill any American they can find   Mr  President  3 613 brave American souls will never again sit at a family table  play with their children  or return to their jobs and their communities  Ninety one of those men and women came from New Jersey  They set their boots on the ground in Iraq never expecting they would not put them back on American soil again  Now their faces and their stories live on only in our memories     But the solemn story those numbers tell does not stop there  Nearly 27 000 troops have left combat with wounds to their body  More than 800 of them have lost limbs or sight or other senses  Many more have left with their minds totally impaired  More than 30 000 soldiers now live with post traumatic stress disorder or brain injuries  robbing them of the ability to think clearly or perform tasks that once came easily  They put themselves in the line of fire and fought to give the President s policy a chance  but the policy has failed    It was more than three years ago that the President  in military dress  staged on the deck of the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln  proudly declared   mission accomplished    Mission accomplished  A declaration of victory in millions of American minds  How casual  How cruel  How inept  The President did this without hesitation or pause or the idea of the cost soldiers would come to endure in the future and the hellfire they would face  There were 139 American soldiers who had died by that date  by the day that   mission accomplished   was declared  Compare that with today s count  which stands above 3 600  Mr  President  139 American soldiers then    mission accomplished    and now the death toll is over 3 600    Mission accomplished    a show of grandeur  a curtain of disaster  misleading  and I don t know if the President really understood what was taking place in front of his eyes   Today  the President continues to use statements that defy reality  Vice President Cheney joined in  He said in those times    We will be greeted as liberators with sweets and treats    with not a hint of intelligence available before that  Today  the President continues to use statements that defy reality  We have to look back a little bit to see when Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld said this war could last six days  six weeks  perhaps  I doubt  six months  He said that in February of 2003  a month before the invasion  What were they thinking  It is hard to understand  They were getting intelligence  They had the best information available  and they didn t use it     Just last week  the President said    The same folks that are bombing innocent people in Iraq were the ones who attacked us in America on September 11th  This statement smacks of the same careless rhetoric we heard four years ago  The most frightening part about that statement is either President Bush actually believes what he is saying  doesn t bother to check  or is he deliberately distracting the American people   The fact is that Osama bin Laden and al Qaida attacked us on 9 11 and Iraq had nothing to do with the tragedy of 9 11  The Defense Department s own inspector general confirmed this past February that the Saddam Hussein regime was not directly cooperating with al Qaida before the U S  invasion of Iraq  Has the President forgotten about Osama bin Laden  the man responsible for inflicting those wounds on the victims  their families  and this country  The war with al Qaida and the hunt for Osama bin Laden began and continues outside of Iraq  Yet Osama bin Laden is still at large  and al Qaida has become stronger as a result of President Bush s failed policies     This administration took its eye off the ball  Instead of capturing or killing Osama bin Laden  we are stuck in the middle of a civil war in Iraq with ever escalating American casualties  That is why some of us in this Congress believe deep in our minds and in our souls that this carnage must end and we have to fight to bring our troops home from Iraq    We are fighting with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle who are giving us reasons to continue with the surge and continue with the exposure in harm s way of our brave men and women   Millions of Americans are begging us for a change of course  They are tired of having their sons and daughters coming home in flag covered coffins  coffins that are hidden from the public eye by order of the Pentagon  They don t even let pictures be taken of those flag draped coffins showing the honor that is bestowed upon the person in that coffin     The American people want Congress to step in and start to bring our troops home in a responsible way  The amendment by Senators Levin and Reed would do just that  It would begin to redeploy our troops out of Iraq within 120 days and remove all combat troops by the end of April of next year  Some American forces would remain to perform counterterrorism operations  protect U S  personnel  and to train Iraqi forces    This amendment reflects the will of the American people  and it is a responsible way to phase our troops out of the civil war in Iraq  But instead of having a vote to decide where a majority of the Congress stands  our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are standing in the way  They are resorting to process to keep us from having a vote so that the American people can see very clearly where we each stand on this issue  So we stayed here all night  That is not much of a sacrifice  that is not much when you consider our people in Iraq and Afghanistan   Soon  every Senator will go on record  and their constituents will know whether they want to continue the President s failed policy or are they looking for a new  brighter day  a chance to bring our people back to their families     Some of our colleagues on the other side have called for change  If you look at recent votes  seven of them had the courage to stand with the Democrats and say  Yes  we agree that this conflict has gone on long enough and we ought to start doing something to bring them home  But with the President dug in on staying the course  saying the right thing is not enough  Change will only come with a vote    So I ask my colleagues to stand up and support the Levin Reed amendment so we can begin to bring our men and women home  Let the American people hear our sincerity  and they will when they see procedural attempts to hide this vote and obstruct the return    The slogan they are using is   cut and run    The result would be   stay and die       I yield the floor and the remainder of my time                          Questions or Comments

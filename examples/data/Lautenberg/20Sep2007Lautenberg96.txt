                                                                               Contact  Press Office  202  224 3224 Thursday  September 20  2007       WASHINGTON  D C    Sen  Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ  today introduced legislation to protect communities from illness by requiring better monitoring  notification and reporting of sewer overflows   The public has a right to know about potentially harmful pollution in their water  My bill will require sewer systems to be monitored regularly for sewage overflows and ensure that our neighborhoods are alerted quickly if public health is at risk  said Sen  Lautenberg  Notifying the public of sewer overflows will protect communities and build support for needed investment in our infrastructure to address contaminated stormwater and sewer overflows   Sen  Lautenbergs bill  the Sewage Overflow Right To Know Act of 2007  would reduce the annual number of human illnesses from contact with untreated sewage by informing communities of sewer overflows discharging waste into their local waterways within 24 hours    The measure would provide notification of sewer overflows by requiring sewage treatment operators    Monitor their systems for sewage overflows by using a management program or technology that will alert them of sewer overflows in a timely manner     Notify the public  public health officials and other affected downstream entities  including drinking water suppliers  of any sewer overflows that endanger human health     Report to the state or Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  all sewer overflows within 24 hours of becoming aware of the overflow and follow up with a written report explaining the duration and volume of the overflow and steps taken to mitigate the overflow  and    Make monitoring and notification eligible for funding via the Clean Water State Revolving Fund    Every year  millions of Americans become sick from waterborne illnesses after coming into contact with water contaminated by sewer overflows  Sewer overflows occur regularly    tens of thousands of sewer overflows every year release billions of gallons of sewage into our waters  Aging wastewater infrastructure and sprawl contribute to wastewater systems becoming overwhelmed  leading to sewer overflows   According to the EPA  between 1 8 and 3 5 million Americans become ill every year from recreational contact with waters contaminated by sanitary sewer overflows  Vulnerable populations  including the elderly and children  are particularly susceptible   The bacteria  viruses and parasites found in untreated sewage can cause severe short term symptoms including gastrointestinal problems  infections and fever  as well as serious chronic conditions such as heart  liver or kidney failure  arthritis and cancer   Currently  there is no consistent monitoring  reporting and public notification requirement for sewer overflows    Companion legislation has been introduced in the House by Rep  Tim Bishop  D NY  and Rep  Frank LoBiondo  R NJ    When it comes to public sources of water  what you don t know can hurt you  said Congressman Tim Bishop  NY 1   a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee  That is why I introduced the Right to Know Act in the House earlier this year  I am pleased to join Senator Lautenberg to ensure that all Americans can protect themselves and their families from contact with untreated sewage and to reduce economic losses due to waterborne illness   Each year  millions of Americans become sick as a result of swimming in water contaminated by sewer overflows  Coastal communities and beach goers have a right to know when the water quality poses a danger to public health  said Congressman Frank A  LoBiondo  NJ 02   Im pleased Senator Lautenberg has introduced this companion legislation to the bill Representative Bishop and I introduced earlier this year  This legislation would help save millions of American from getting ill from water borne diseases each year                         Questions or Comments

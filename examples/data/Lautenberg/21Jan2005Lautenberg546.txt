State                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Friday  January 21  2005      WASHINGTON  DC    In a letter sent today to the U S  Secretary of Transportation  New Jersey Senators Frank  R  Lautenberg and Jon S  Corzine expressed their serious concerns over the Bush administration s decision to hold up vital transportation infrastructure funds  and called on Secretary Norm Mineta to take the steps necessary to provide the  350 million allocated by Congress for New Jersey        New Jersey s transportation infrastructure is vital to millions of travelers and the entire East Coast economy  Every day that new safety  maintenance  and capacity initiatives are delayed means travelers and the flow of commerce throughout the region face needless risks  In short  the Administration s actions could have lasting negative impacts on the entire region    Furthermore  it seems to us that any efforts to improve the integrity of the contracting process can only protect the notion of fair competition  not injure it   the lawmakers wrote in their letter to Secretary Mineta       The Bush administration has taken the position that New Jersey s recent reforms in its contracting processes  known as  pay to play  reforms  are inconsistent with federal law  Specifically  the Administration claims that this effort to restore the integrity of the competitive bidding process actually limits competition by shrinking the pool of qualified bidders        In separate action to shake lose the federal highway funds for a number of important ongoing infrastructure projects in the state  Lautenberg last week spoke with the head of the Federal Highway Administration  Mary E  Peters  who explained that Secretary Mineta alone retains the authority to approve the authorization of the  350 million in federal funds set aside for New Jersey       A copy of the entire letter is attached to this release       January 21  2005      Norman Y  Mineta Secretary United States Department of Transportation 400 Seventh Street SW  S 1 Washington  DC 20590      Dear Secretary Mineta       We are alarmed that the U S  Department of Transportation  USDOT  has decided to withhold authorization of Federal funding for transportation infrastructure projects in New Jersey       New Jersey s transportation infrastructure is vital to millions of travelers and the entire East Coast economy  Every day that new safety  maintenance  and capacity initiatives are delayed means travelers and the flow of commerce throughout the region face needless risks  In short  The Administration s actions could have lasting negative impacts on the entire region       We understand that the Administration has taken the position that New Jersey s recent reforms in its contracting processes  known as  pay to play  reforms  are inconsistent with Federal law  Specifically  the Administration claims that this effort to restore the integrity of the competitive bidding process actually limits competition  We are dismayed because this interpretation of Federal law seems to place the political goals of the Administration over the transportation needs of New Jersey  Furthermore  it seems to us that any efforts to improve the integrity of the contracting process can only protect the notion of fair competition  not injure it       In light of New Jersey s dire transportation needs  we ask that you grant the necessary authorizations so that our State can go forward with its important transportation projects  Since the expiration of the landmark Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century  TEA 21   on September 30  2003  New Jersey  like every other state  has already suffered without a long term Federal transportation authorization  The Administration s role in that delay has already worked to defer much needed transportation improvements throughout the country  We fear that any further delays to transportation projects in our state will have adverse consequences       Sincerely       FRANK R  LAUTENBERG JON S  CORZINE                   Questions or Comments

                                                                                  Contact  Alex Formuzis  202  224 7340 Wednesday  June 21  2006      WASHINGTON  D C    United States Senator Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ delivered the following remarks today during the debate over when U S  forces should begin to come home from Iraq      Mr  President  I rise to speak in support of the resolution put forth by the senior Senator from Michigan  and I appreciate the fact that he has framed the debate on the war in Iraq  both for the Senate and for the American people       Last week  the American military death toll in Iraq passed 2 500   It was a tragic milestone   And the American people are not happy about it  because the President has not articulated what exactly we are trying to accomplish in Iraq       I maintain a gallery of pictures of U S  servicepeople who have died in Iraq and Afghanistan outside the front door of my office  to remind me and all who visit my office of these American heroes       As a veteran  I find the current situation in Iraq especially painful    because I know what those troops and their families are going through       I know the Bush Administration is saying that some Iraqis are worried about us leaving   But I say this  the American people are worried about us staying      What more can we do for the Iraqi people   We have spent 20 billion dollars of U S  taxpayer funds to rebuild their nation  s infrastucture  We have helped them hold three elections   We have trained and armed their police and military         I say  it  s time for them to take control of their own country       I have heard my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say that we would bring   dishonor    to those who lost their lives if we begin to leave Iraq        But ask the families with loved ones over there how they feel   I met in my Newark office with a group of families with loved ones in Iraq        including a mother who lost her son   As far as they were concerned  it would bring dishonor to other families if we just stay there with no plan for the future        So why are we having so much trouble securing Iraq   The answer is clear  the Administration had no plan in place to do it   And when they tried  we saw mistep after mistep by the civilian leaders in the Pentagon      And the leadership problems at the Pentagon start at the top     Mr  President  our troops on the ground have not been well served by the Secretary of Defense       Some say   Send the troops home           but I believe our first order of business should be to send Secretary Rumsfeld home       Secretary Rumsfeld has been denying reality since 2003   And he will not admit that the Administration grossly miscalulated what would be needed to win the war       This Administration went to war on the cheap      Not enough troops   Not enough body armor   Not enough help from our allies   And our troops have paid the price for these mistakes       There were so many mistakes and miscalculations by the Bush Administration        it is staggering       Secretary Rumsfeld said that Iraqis would welcome U S  troops  and that the Iraqi resistance would be limited   That was obviously wrong       He also failed to build coalitions with our allies   One of the few major allies that did join the coalition was Poland  which sent about 1 600 troops  But they began withdrawing early this year   Half are gone already    and by the end of the year  Poland will have all its troops out of Iraq       And just this week  the Japanese announced they will withdraw their troops  So far  sixteen nations who provided some assistance in Iraq have withdrawn their troops         This Administration  s failure to build a real coalition has caused our troops to bear the vast majority of risk and suffer the casualties       Secretary Rumsfeld said the war would be short    I doubt six months     he said   More than three years later  we know that assessment was tragically wrong        Additionally  Secretary Rumsfeld was also way off on the cost of the war    He said it would cost no more than 100 billion dollars         But the current cost is a staggering 320 billion dollars        And now we are experiencing a crisis in military recruiting   But even about that  Secretary Rumsfeld is in denial       Whether in public or in private  the Secretary claims recruiting is fine   It  s not  Here is the reality  The Army National Guard and Reserve are falling well short of their goals   And the only reason other branches are meeting goals is because the Pentagon has reduced the target numbers       Mr  President  eight retired Generals have come forward to say what many in the military have been thinking for years  it  s time for Secretary Rumsfeld to leave his post         One of the generals  General Eaton  who served in Iraq  said the following about Secretary Rumsfeld    QUOTE          In sum  he has shown himself incompetent strategically  operationally and tactically  and is far more than anyone else responsible for what has happened to our important mission in Iraq  Mr  Rumsfeld must step down          But instead of taking a stand like the Generals  we have heard our colleagues on the other side of the aisle simply repeat talking points that were handed to them by the Bush Administration       We know this because the Secretary of Defense sent a Republican briefing book to Democrats by mistake last week       This briefing book is a three ring binder of spin   And it contains the same spin you are hearing from the other side of the chamber today       Instead of developing talking points and spin for Republican Senators  Secretary Rumsfeld should concentrate on putting together a plan for our troops in Iraq       We need a fresh start and honest leadership    and we are not going to get either one as long as Secretary Rumsfeld is in charge at the Pentagon     Secretary Rumsfeld must go and it is time to start bringing our troops home      I yield the floor                      Questions or Comments

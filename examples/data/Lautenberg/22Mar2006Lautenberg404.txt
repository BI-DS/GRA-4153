                                                                              Lautenberg and Menendez Urge Quick Action on Federal Assistance for Flood Protection Projects along Ramapo                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Wednesday  March 22  2006      WASHINGTON  DC    In a letter sent today to President Bush s budget chief  United States Senators Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ  and Robert Menendez  D NJ  urged the Bush administration to act quickly  and approve federal funds required to shore up flood protection projects along the Ramapo River  The lawmakers made this call for action as New Jersey moves closer to flood season this Spring         A shutdown or termination of the Pompton Lakes dam contract could cause a serious public safety issue  including the potential for loss of life and property           The Katrina disaster showed us first hand the tragedy that can occur with dilapidated dams and floodgates  We urge you to provide the funding for this critical project before construction is terminated   wrote the lawmakers to Josh Bolten  the Director of the Office of Management and Budget  OMB          We cannot sit by and hope flooding won t happen along the Ramapo River this season  We need to act fast to ensure those who live in the vicinity are safe   said Lautenberg         Now is not the time for bureaucratic red tape and administrative road blocks   Menendez said   It is imperative that we act proactively to protect the communities surrounding the Ramapo River  by installing the control flood gates as soon as possible        The Ramapo River at Oakland flood control project consists of two construction contracts   1  a channel modification of 5 800 feet of the Ramapo River and  2  the installation of flood control gates at the existing Pompton Lakes Dam  The channel modification contract has been completed  while the installation of the flood control gates in the Pompton Lakes Dam is in progress and slated for completion this August        Senator Lautenberg has secured over  4 5 million in the last two years for flood control projects along the Ramapo River       A copy of the letter sent to Mr  Bolten is attached       Dear Director Bolten        We are writing to you about an urgent matter of great importance to the people of Pompton Lakes  Wayne  and Oakland  New Jersey  These towns face the possibility of catastrophic flooding this spring  including the potential for loss of life and property  if the flood protection project along the Ramapo River does not immediately receive  2 5 million  We anticipate approval by the Assistant Secretary of the Army  Civil Works   John Paul Woodley  Jr  of these funds and we urge a speedy confirmation by OMB  These funds will allow for the continued construction of the crucial final stage of the project  the flood control gates at the Pompton Lakes Dam        The Ramapo River at Oakland flood control project consists of two construction contracts   1  a channel modification of 5 800 feet of the Ramapo River and  2  the installation of flood control gates at the existing Pompton Lakes Dam  The channel modification contract has been completed  while the installation of the flood control gates in the Pompton Lakes Dam is in progress and slated for completion this August  Over the fiscal years between 2002 and 2004   4 5 million has been reprogrammed from the Oakland project for other priority national needs with the expectation that these funds would be restored to the project in the future  Completing the existing contract on the Pompton Lakes Dam in FY06 will require an estimated  3 8 million  but only  1 3 million was provided to the Ramapo River at Oakland flood control project in the 2006 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act  P L  109 103   An additional  2 5 million is needed to complete the Pompton Lakes contract and to prevent shutdown or termination of the contract       A shutdown or termination of the Pompton Lakes dam contract could cause a serious public safety issue  including the potential for loss of life and property  Flooding on two occasions has inundated Pompton Dam and upstream residents of Pompton Lakes  Wayne  and Oakland  New Jersey  Most recently  remnants of Tropical Storm Tammy  Hurricane Wilma  and other intermittent systems caused continual precipitation that saturated the Ramapo River Basin for most of October 2005  These events received national media coverage and highlighted the urgent need to complete the construction to provide much needed flood relief to the area        The contract for the Pompton Lakes Dam at the Ramapo River at Oakland project is set to expire on March 31  2006  If  2 5 million is not reprogrammed for this contract by that time  construction will be halted or even terminated  The Katrina disaster showed us first hand the tragedy that can occur with dilapidated dams and floodgates  We urge you to provide the funding for this critical project before construction is terminated       Sincerely       FRANK R  LAUTENBERG ROBERT MENENDEZ                        Questions or Comments

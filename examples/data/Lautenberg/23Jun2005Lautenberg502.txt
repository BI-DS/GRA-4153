                                                                              Senators Fight to Preserve Funding for States with High HIV AIDS Populations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Thursday  June 23  2005      WASHINGTON  D C     Fighting to protect services for Americans living with HIV  several United States senators called on the Government Accountability Office  GAO  to preserve funding for cities with high incidents of HIV and AIDS  under Title I of the Ryan White CARE Act  Signing a letter to the GAO were Senators Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ   Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY   Charles Schumer  D NY   Dianne Feinstein  D CA  and Barbara Boxer  D CA        The two biggest funding streams in the CARE Act are Titles I and II  Title I money is for cities with high rates of AIDS cases and Title II money is for states with the bulk of the money going to AIDS Drug Assistance Programs  ADAPs   New Jersey receives both money for cities and states because of the high incidence of AIDS in the State        At a hearing Thursday in the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committees subcommittee on Federal Financial Management  the GAO presented preliminary findings on variations in funding between states that receive funding for individual cities  and those that only receive statewide grants  States that receive funding for cities under Title I of the CARE Act are in danger of losing those resources because of the perception they are  double dipping   But the GAO failed to account for the scope of services provided  the cost of living in various areas  and the differences between community   driven services provided by cities and the state level services provided under Title II        Changing such an allocation so that states receive funding only for cases located outside of EMAs would devastate the current AIDS service  and result in delays or denials of care for the vast majority of people living with AIDS   the Senators wrote in their letter       Senator Lautenberg coauthored the Ryan White AIDS CARE Act and helped secure funding for the program  He also helped include Jersey City as one of special targeted recipients of aid  along with the Newark metro area        HIV continues to take a huge toll in our cities  and people will suffer if we reduce services   said Lautenberg   We have to focus our resources where they are needed most   and that means the areas with the highest rates of HIV and AIDS       The text of the letter is available below        The Honorable David M  Walker Comptroller General of the United States United States Government Accountability Office  GAO  441 G Street  N W  Washington  D C  20548      Dear Mr  Walker       As Senators representing states with high HIV AIDS caseloads and populations served by Title I Eligible Metropolitan Areas  EMAs   we are concerned with the preliminary data as presented in the testimony of the GAO before the Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management  Government Information  and International Security of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee on Thursday  June 23  We would hope that in the final report  the GAO will take into account the necessity for stable  continued funding for the Title I EMA program  which provides community directed services  care and treatment to the vast majority of those living with HIV AIDS in the United States       We would like the GAO to address the following issues in its final report       The role of the grandfather clause in ensuring service provision  In the Ryan White CARE Act  a clause from the 1996 reauthorization states that EMAs designated prior to fiscal year 1996 will remain an eligible metropolitan area in subsequent fiscal years  Even if the criteria for designation as an EMA are not currently met by several grantees  over 70  of the Americans living with AIDS reside in areas served by Title I funding  Clearly  the burden of the domestic epidemic is still disproportionately based in cities that receive Title I funding  We would ask that  in the final report  the GAO include a discussion of the barriers to care and treatment in EMAs that would arise were the grandfather clause to be lifted  We would also ask that you consider the role the grandfather clause has played in protecting areas with a high prevalence rate  as defined in the 1990 CARE Act  These areas would have been severely impacted by the 1996 reauthorization s elimination of the density factor from the Title I formula were it not for this grandfather clause        The inadequacies of using a per capita formula in funding analyses  There has been some concern that the amount allocated to various regions does not represent an equal distribution  on a per capita basis  of funding  What such an analysis fails to consider is both the level of services provided and the cost of living in various areas  Per capita funding formulations do not address the scope of services provided and the true extent of need in high cost of living areas like New York City  San Francisco  and other EMAs  In your report  we ask that the GAO consider both the range and actual cost of services provided in states and local communities prior to any analysis of funding distributions       The continued need for separate Title I and Title II funding streams  There is a perception that states with EMAs are somehow  double dipping  into Ryan White CARE Act funding  as such areas benefit from both Title I and Title II funding streams  However  such criticism fails to take into account differences between the local  community driven services provided in EMAs  and the state level services funded by Title II  This issue has already been addressed legislatively in the CARE Act  Formula allocations in Title II specifically place a greater weight on cases in non EMA areas  so that more funding will be directed to non EMA states  Changing such an allocation so that states receive funding only for cases located outside of EMAs would devastate the current AIDS service infrastructure  and result in delays or denials of care for the vast majority of people living with AIDS  We would ask that when examining Title I vs  Title II funding issues  the GAO take into account the impact of reducing Title II funding upon service provision in these states with the greatest burden of cases        Thank you for your consideration of our request                        Questions or Comments

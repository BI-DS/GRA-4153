 D NJ  and U S  Rep  Frank Pallone  Jr   D NJ  today sent a letter to Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen voicing their opposition to a plan to make the Shark River Coast Guard Station in Avon by the Sea a seasonal station and urged the Admiral to reconsider the decision  A COPY OF THE LETTER FOLLOWS     For years  the Shark River Coast Guard Station has been open year round  providing critical safety resources for a thriving boating and fishing community This summer  the Coast Guard announced plans to close the station from October until the week before Memorial Day    In their letter to Admiral Allen  Lautenberg and Pallone voiced concern over the proposal since the winter months present riskier conditions for boaters on the Atlantic Ocean Last year  13 of the 33 search and rescue cases handled by the station occurred during the off season months   The two New Jersey lawmakers wrote that had this station been closed during these emergencies response boats would have to travel an additional 6 miles from the Manasquan Station  which would result in longer response times They continued  this could mean life or death for boaters in peril     We believe that under the Coast Guard s plan  boaters in the Shark River Inlet area will be put at greater risk of not having the Coast Guard respond in time to prevent the loss of lives  Lautenberg and Pallone wrote in their letter to Admiral Allen We oppose this plan  and we ask you to reconsider    Lautenberg and Pallone also vowed today to explore legislative solutions in the coming months if the Coast Guard refuses to reconsider its decision   Shark River is an important facility for New Jersey s boating and fishing community  said Lautenberg  Boaters using this port need to know that the Coast Guard will be able to provide critical assistance in case of an emergency  As we ve done with similar threats of closure in the past  we will work to keep the station open and keep our boaters safe    I m hopeful that the Coast Guard was convinced by August s public forum that closing the Shark River Station would unnecessarily put a lot of boaters and fishermen at risk  Pallone said If the Coast Guard ignores our concerns  Senator Lautenberg and I will work through the legislative process to keep this station open at all times    The letter comes after the two New Jersey lawmakers learned of the proposal earlier this summer In August  at the urging of Pallone  the Coast Guard held a public forum to present the plan and to hear the opinions of concerned citizens Nearly everyone in attendance  from boaters to fishermen  voiced strong opposition to the plan    Ten years ago  the Coast Guard proposed a similar plan that would have closed the Shark River Coast Guard Station on November 15th for the winter season Lautenberg and Pallone were successful in fighting that proposal and for the past decade the station has been staffed with search and rescue support 24 hours a day  seven days a week  365 days a year   October 23  2007  Admiral Thad W  Allen Commandant  U S  Coast Guard  2100 Second Street  SW  Washington  DC 20593  Dear Admiral Allen   We read with great interest a story in last Sundays Washington Post Magazine in which you were interviewed about your early career experiences with the Coast Guards search and rescue program We found your recollection about the rescue of mariners off the Jersey Shore in blizzard conditions remarkable  and are thankful every day for your dedication and that of the other men and women of the U S  Coast Guard   However  we are horrified to learn that the Coast Guard plans to reduce operations and response capabilities this year on the Jersey Shore at the Coast Guard Station in Shark River Inlet  NJ This stationwhich we understand you intend to close from October to May  would deprive this area of critical safety resources for a thriving boating community   Fishermen  both commercial and recreational  fish throughout the year off the Jersey shore  not just during the summer months In 2006  13 of the 33 search and rescue cases handled at the Shark River Coast Guard Station occurred during the off season or non summer months If Station Shark River were closed when these cases occurred  response boats would have to travel an additional 6 miles from Station Manasquan which would result in longer response times This could mean life or death for boaters in peril   You probably know as well as anyone that in the winter months  the Atlantic Ocean presents riskier conditions for boaters Under these dangerous conditions  it is vital to have sufficient Coast Guard search and rescue capabilities   Furthermore  among their many important duties  Station Shark River personnel monitor boating safety  including incidents of boating under the influence and proper compliance with boat equipment regulations With the large number of recreational fishermen and recreational boaters on the Jersey Shore  this aspect of the Coast Guard s mission is vital to maritime safety in the region   Based on your interview  it does not appear that during your early years of service you viewed search and rescue calls simply as casesrather  on the other end of those calls were peopleboaters in distress  whose lives may be in serious danger We hope your first hand experience on the Jersey Shore will remind you that time is of the essence in these situations   We believe that under the Coast Guards plan  boaters in the Shark River Inlet area will be put at greater risk of not having the Coast Guard respond in time to prevent the loss of lives We oppose this plan  and we ask you to reconsider it     30                    Questions or Comments

                                                                              2 000 U S  Soldiers Killed in Iraq                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Tuesday  October 25  2005      WASHINGTON  D C     U S  Senators Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ  delivered today the following statement on the floor of the United States Senate marking the two thousand U S  soldiers killed in Iraq         Mr  President  there is a dark cloud hanging over our nation  That cloud emanates from Iraq  and has rained countless tears on American families from across our nation who have lost loved ones       And now  we have received somber news about how many American troops have sacrificed their lives for our nation  There are 2 000 dead  Two thousand       It is a grim milestone  And in addition to the two thousand dead  more than 15 000 have been seriously wounded       These are more than numbers  Every casualty is a life cut short or torn apart       Mr  President  outside my office across the street in the Hart building  I have set up a memorial to these fallen heroes  When you look at those faces    the young lives cut short    it breaks your heart        When I started the Senate memorial  I hoped that major combat would soon be over and that our casualties would be minimal        But major combat has dragged on      and the memorial display has unfortunately grown and grown       It has gotten to the point that the memorial takes up most of the space on the landing outside my office        There is a similar memorial set up in the Longworth House Office Building by Representatives Rahm Emmanuel and Walter Jones        I encourage all of my colleagues to visit these memorials and pay tribute to our troops       As we reach this grim milestone today  it is critical that we examine the situation we are facing in Iraq       The President made a speech today  He basically said   Let s keep doing what we have been doing   We also heard the usual rhetoric about  spreading freedom         But do we need more slogans       I remember the President s slogan on the aircraft carrier   Mission Accomplished   The President declared  major combat operations  to be over       But since the President declared  Mission Accomplished  in May 2003 we have lost 1 855 troops        As the debacle on the aircraft carrier proved  slogans are only as good as the banner they are written on       But  Mr  President  we don t need more slogans  we need a plan       A plan that will provide relief to our troops so they aren t shouldering all of the burden in Iraq       The President and his team ignored the wise advice of the State Department and alienated our usual allies before the war with incredible arrogance and ineptitude       Last year  the President scolded my colleague Senator Kerry while debating this issue  alleging that he  forgot Poland   But even Poland is pulling out of Iraq now       With the exception of British troops in Basra  we are essentially going it alone across the rest of Iraq       And as our troops go it alone  they have to live with President Bush s taunt to our enemies   Bring  em on   I ask the President  have they sufficiently brought them on       What the troops on the ground need is less cowboy talk and more of a plan that defines our specific goals       They would like to know exactly how many Iraqi troops need to be trained before our soldiers can begin to come home  But all we hear from President Bush over and over again is that we need to  complete the mission   But then we are not told what the mission is       Mr  President  today I hope every American will pause and reflect on the price that has been paid by our brave soldiers       Their bravery is above question    but the Administration s policy in Iraq is not        The American people have a right and even a duty to demand answers from our government       Our troops deserve nothing less       Every flag draped coffin represents a family that will never again share a moment with their beloved spouse  child or sibling  It was very telling early on in this conflict when the Administration banned the photography of flag draped coffins landing back on our shores from Iraq       Why ban these tributes to heroes that sacrificed their lives for our country  The Administration argued about an invasion of privacy        But that is a red herring    of course the funerals themselves are private  but at issue was the return of these caskets to Dover Air Force Base       Both Presidents Reagan and Clinton publicly met flag draped coffins on the tarmac at Dover  But under this President  we cannot even take photographs       We should honor    not hide    flag draped coffins  They are a symbol of the respect  honor and dignity that our fallen heroes deserve        And we honor today the 2 000 heroes who sacrificed their lives for our country        I urge the President to pay tribute to their memory by offering a realistic  concise plan that will allow us to finally transfer power to Iraqis and bring our troops home

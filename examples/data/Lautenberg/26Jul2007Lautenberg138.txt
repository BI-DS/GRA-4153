                                                                               Contact  Press Office  202  224 3224 Thursday  July 26  2007      WASHINGTON  D C   Sens  Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ  and Robert Menendez  D NJ  joined with Reps  Jim Saxton  R NJ  and Frank LoBiondo  R NJ  to comment on the findings in the Warren Grove accident report  The New Jersey lawmakers were briefed via teleconference in Sen  Lautenbergs office by the U S  Air Force and New Jersey Air Guard on the forest fires that destroyed nearly 20 000 acres of the Pine Barrens in May    This investigation proved that failures by the pilot and the Guard led to these forest fires  said Sen  Lautenberg  The Guard must work to ensure there will be no more accidents  I will work with the community and the Governor to ensure that the Guard becomes a better neighbor and improves safety at the range   Its clear that there were errors at multiple levels in the chain of command  and thats highly concerning for the safety of New Jersey residents  This type of systematic failure  which led to homes destroyed and lives uprooted  is unacceptable  and we need to see a set of strong recommendations that will guarantee that the lives  safety and property of the citizens come first  said Sen  Menendez   We know the training mission at Warren Grove is crucial to the existence of the New Jersey National s Guard s F 16 Fighter Wing in Atlantic City  Saxton said  The facilities are also used by McGuire AFB  Fort Dix and Fort Monmouth and are an important national asset to the National Guard for developing the skills critical to survival in combat  What we want to see  however  is real improvements to safety for the surrounding communities  This wildfire should have never happened  and we want to see steps in place to prevent it from happening again  Our Pine Barrens are one of New Jersey s greatest natural resources  and any threat to it or the people who live there must be minimized   This fire was certainly preventable and my sympathies go out to those still recovering from this accident  I applaud the Air Force for their quick response and assistance to those affected  I also applaud the 177th Fighter Wing  which maintains operational control of the Range  for quickly implementing safety precautions to prevent a future incident  said Congressman LoBiondo  There is no comparable range on the East Coast to Warren Grove  which serves as a critical training tool for not only the 177th   the nation s premier homeland security unit   but also the training needs to other Air Force  Army  Marine  and National Guard units  Any plans to close the range would precipitate the closure of the 177th Fighter Wing in Atlantic County  which would be detrimental to the region s and the nation s security   The Accident Investigation Board  AIB  report was prepared by the U S  Air Force and concluded that there were pervasive and systemic failures leading to the accident    from the initial information communicated by the on the ground flight control officer to the communications between the two pilots to the decision to drop the flare  The conclusion to the Statement of Opinion in report as expressed by the President of Accident Investigation Board  Air Force Major General Emmett Titshaw  is summarized as follows   There is clear and convincing evidence that the cause of the fires that started at Warren Grove Gunnery Range on May 15 was wingman pilot error  The wingman pilot deployed a flare or flares that impacted the range and ignited a fire  which spread beyond the Warren Grove Range boundaries  The pilot deployed these flares below the Warren Grove Range restricted altitude for flare use of 500 feet above ground level  Substantially contributing to this mishap were the failure of the lead pilot to communicate with the wingman pilot concerning his intended use of flares and to properly coordinate the wingmans intent to use flares during the flight on the range coordination sheet  the range control officers failure to convey additional restrictions on flare use at the Warren Grove Range  the wingman pilots lack of information concerning additional restrictions on flare use at the Warren Grove Range  and the unplanned show of force maneuver flown by the wingman pilot and requested by the Warren Grove range control officer   The fire burned more than 17 000 acres and displaced thousands of residents in the Pine Barrens when a flare was dropped by a New Jersey Air Guard F 16 jet on a training mission    In May  Sens  Lautenberg and Menendez met with General Sid Clarke  Deputy Director of the Air National Guard  and Adjutant General Glen Rieth  Commander of the New Jersey National Guard  to discuss the fire and plans to improve safety and operations at the range  Reps  Saxton and LoBiondo have also spoken with Gen  Reith and Col  Randall King  Commander of 177th Fighter Wing out of Atlantic County    The fire in May was the latest in a string of incidents near the Warren Grove range     In April 1999  a Pennsylvania National Guard A 10 jet aiming for the range instead dropped a dummy bomb a mile off target over the Pinelands in Burlington County  touching off a fire that burned 12 000 acres and lasted four days      In June 2001  another errant bomb dropped by an F 16 caused a fire that scorched 1 600 acres when the pilot missed a target area that had been cleared of trees and brush      In January 2002  an F 16 crashed near the Garden State Parkway    the third such crash at the range since 1992      And in November 2004  a serious accident occurred when an in flight F 16 mistakenly discharged rounds when the pilot applied too much pressure on the trigger  The inert rounds traveled some distance and eventually landed on an elementary school  That caused the plane to fire 25 rounds from its artillery cannon instead of simply activating a targeting laser beam as he had intended  Fortunately  the school was empty aside from a custodian  and no one was injured                             Questions or Comments

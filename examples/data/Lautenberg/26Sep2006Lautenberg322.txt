                                                                                      Contact  Alex Formuzis  202  224 7340 Tuesday  September 26  2006         WASHINGTON  D C      In an effort to stop attempts to take Federal HIV AIDS funds away from areas with a high concentration of people living with the disease  Democrats and Republicans in Congress have joined together and offered emergency legislation in both chambers to temporarily reauthorize the Ryan White Act and increase the funding level so negotiations can continue          Last week  the House Energy and Commerce Committee passed a revised version of the Ryan White Act with a new formula that would steer resources away from states like New Jersey and New York that have very high numbers of people living with HIV AIDS  while giving more funds to states with relatively low numbers of HIV AIDS cases          Since its enactment  the Ryan White Act funds have helped millions of HIV AIDS patients receive the care and treatment services they need to live healthy and productive lives   Unfortunately  under the bill sent to the full Senate for a vote  many places that have a high number of HIV AIDS cases and substantial need for funding  including NY  NJ  FL  IL and CA  would lose millions of dollars   Such an outcome would effectively dismantle entire systems of care and place patients at risk             Changing the formula so more federal funding goes to states with relatively low numbers of people infected with HIV AIDS  while taking it away from states with high numbers of cases will put the lives of literally thousands of people at serious risk     said Lautenberg    This is absolutely unconscionable               It is beyond belief that the federal government would shift funds from states with the highest incidence of HIV AIDS  to states with much lower levels     Menendez said    This action is not only short sighted  but will place an extraordinary burden on states like New Jersey who serve large populations of HIV AIDS patients  Our measure aims to minimize the potentially disastrous effects of ill advised HIV AIDS policies    policies that hamper our nation  s overall war on HIV AIDS                              We are committed to making sure that those living with HIV and AIDS get the treatment they need    That must be the bottom line   We must ensure that the New York region  the epicenter of the AIDS epidemic  continues to have adequate funding while also recognizing the growing needs in states across the country   This is the right and fair approach   said Senator Clinton             The current version of the reauthorization defies every iota of reason  Why should states like New York  which have the highest percentage of AIDS and HIV patients in the country  be stripped of its funding that goes to crucial treatment and prevention programs     Schumer asked    Plain and simple  this reauthorization punishes us for effectively utilizing money allocated by the original CARE act  We  ve reduced the number of HIV patients who eventually develop AIDS but we still have many patients to treat              New Jersey has been at the forefront of treating HIV AIDS for years  but this unfair funding formula would penalize it and several other states for keeping patients alive and well   said Pallone    The alternative legislation we introduced today will prevent this funding formula from becoming law  and will give us an additional year to negotiate a better formula           Lautenberg  Menendez and Pallone noted that New Jersey ranks fifth in the nation in the total number of AIDS cases and number one in the percentage of people with HIV or AIDS who are women          The Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency  CARE  Act is the Federal law that addresses the unmet health needs of persons living with HIV disease by funding primary health care and support services that enhance access to care  First enacted by Congress in 1990  it was amended and reauthorized in 1996 and again in 2000  The CARE Act reaches over 500 000 individuals each year  making it the federal government s largest program specifically for people living with HIV disease  The CARE Act was named after Ryan White  an Indiana teenager whose courageous struggle with HIV AIDS and against AIDS related discrimination helped educate the nation                Those cosponsoring the Lautenberg legislation are fellow Senators Robert Menendez  D NJ   Barack Obama  D IL   Richard J  Durbin  D IL   Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NJ   Charles E

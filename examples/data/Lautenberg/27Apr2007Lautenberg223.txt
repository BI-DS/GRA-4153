                                                                                After Considering Lautenberg s Request for More Than Two Years  Bush Administration Endorses First Change to Federal Gun Law In More Than a Decade                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Contact  Michael Pagan  202  228 6393 Friday  April 27  2007      WASHINGTON  D C    Last night  U S  Sen  Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ  introduced legislation to prohibit terrorist suspects from purchasing firearms  mirroring an Administration plan released yesterday   The bill seeks to close the  terror gap  in federal gun law by giving the Attorney General the power to block gun sales to terror suspects    Under current federal gun law  there is no provision to deny suspected terrorists from purchasing a firearm          It took years  but the Administration finally realized that letting terrorists buy guns is dangerous    This  terror gap  in our gun laws has been open too long and I am going to shut it down   said Sen  Lautenberg       Under the federal Brady Act  a licensed firearms dealer must request a background check through the Federal Bureau of Investigation s  FBI  National Instant Criminal Background Check System  NICS  before an unlicensed individual may purchase a weapon   However  even if a NICS check reveals that the prospective purchaser is a known or suspected terrorist  nothing in current law prevents that person from purchasing a gun unless he or she meets one of the other disqualifying factors  including felony or domestic abuse convictions         In January 2005  the GAO produced a report to Sens  Lautenberg and Biden  D DE  that found that from February 3 to June 30  2004  a total of 44 firearm purchase attempts were made by individuals designated as known or suspected terrorists by the federal government   In 35 cases  the FBI authorized the transactions to proceed because FBI field agents were unable to find any disqualifying information  such as felony convictions or illegal immigrant status  within the federally prescribed three business days        Following the GAO report in March 2005  Sen  Lautenberg wrote letters to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and FBI Director Robert Mueller requesting recommendations on existing laws and Department of Justice  DOJ  regulations permitting terrorists to purchase guns and  in response to the Senator s request  the DOJ created a department wide working group   That working group produced the legislative recommendations that Lautenberg introduced on Thursday       This week    more than two years later    DOJ recommended the introduction of the  Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act of 2007    The Administration s recommendation came only following last week s tragedy at Virginia Tech and the day before Director Mueller s testimony in front of Sen  Lautenberg at a Senate Appropriations Subcommittee hearing on the FBI s 2008 budget        Before I got involved  the Administration refused to even share information with law enforcement about terrorists who purchased guns    Now that the Administration has finally agreed to limit gun sales to terrorists  I am going to push legislation swiftly through Congress to close this  terror gap  loophole   said Lautenberg       Sen  Lautenberg s measure   the  Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act of 2007    specifically            Provides the Attorney General with discretionary authority to deny the transfer of a firearm or the issuance of a firearm or explosives license or permit when a background check reveals that the purchaser is a known or suspected terrorist and the Attorney General reasonably believes that the person may use a firearm or explosives in connection with terrorism            Includes due process safeguards that afford an affected person an opportunity to challenge a denial by the Attorney General  and           Protects the sensitive information upon which terrorist watch list listings are based       Should this new measure become law  it would be the first change to the Brady Law since Sen  Lautenberg s 1996 law that has kept more than 150 000 guns out of the hands of domestic abusers                             Questions or Comments

                                                                              Lautenberg  Lott Introduce Bi Partisan Bill to Fully Fund Amtrak                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Wednesday  July 27  2005      WASHINGTON  DC      Senators Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ   Trent Lott  R MS   Ted Stevens  R AK   chairman of the Commerce  Science and Transportation Committee and Daniel K  Inouye  D HI   Co Chairman of both the Committee and Subcommittee today introduced the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2005 and immediately called on Congress to adopt this legislation to authorize fully funding Amtrak s needs this year  A fact sheet on the bi partisan plan is attached to this release        National passenger rail service isn t a luxury    it s a necessity for giving Americans another transportation choice  while reducing traffic  air pollution and our dependence on foreign oil   said Senator Lautenberg   We have that choice in the Northeast    Amtrak carries four million passengers a year in New Jersey  and just as many passengers ride trains between New York and Washington as fly  But all Americans deserve the choice to ride passenger rail         Our bill improves how Amtrak works and ensures that the taxpayers  money is used more effectively   Senator Lott said   It cuts the Amtrak operating subsidy by 40 percent and creates a new rail capital grant program that states can use to start new inter city passenger rail service  Amtrak as an organization must change culturally to think and run more like a business  That is why our bill requires Amtrak to develop much better financial systems and be held accountable for its use of federal funding         I commend Senator Lott for his leadership on this very important piece of legislation   Senator Stevens said   He and other members of the Commerce Committee  including Co Chairman Inouye and Senator Lautenberg  have worked in a bipartisan fashion to deliver a bill that I hope will gain the support of our Committee and the Senate  Amtrak reform is essential not only for passenger rail users on the East Coast  but all Americans  I look forward to considering the bill and reporting it out of Committee at our markup Thursday         Summary of Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act      Overview      The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act  PRIIA  is a six year reauthorization bill  FY 2006 2011     the same time frame as the Amtrak Board s strategic plan  The bill authorizes funding for Amtrak s capital and operating needs to maintain current operations  upgrade equipment  and return the Northeast Corridor  NEC  to a state of good repair  Over the life of the bill  Amtrak s operating subsidy is reduced by 40  through cost cutting  restructuring  and reform while capital funding is increased  The bill creates an intercity passenger rail capital grant program for the States       Funding Summary      6 Year Funding Totals Average Amtrak Operating Subsidy  3 3 billion  556 million Amtrak Capital Grants  4 9 billion  818 million State Grants  1 4 billion  340 million Existing Amtrak Debt  1 7 billion  287 million Total  11 4 billion  1 9 billion      Amtrak Reforms      Management Improvement  The bill requires a financial accounting system for Amtrak operations and a five year financial plan  The system is monitored by the Department of Transportation Inspector General        Debt  The bill directs the Secretary of the Treasury  in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation and Amtrak  to negotiate the restructuring of Amtrak s debt within one year  If a restructuring results in significant savings  the Secretary of Treasury assumes the restructured debt  with the full faith and credit backing of the Treasury        If no restructuring is possible  Amtrak must pay the debt  Such debt is solely the responsibility of Amtrak  without any implied federal guarantee       Corporate Governance  This bill adds the Amtrak President to the Amtrak Board  bringing the total number of members on the board to nine  Members are required to have either rail  transportation  or a business background       Metrics and Standards  In consultation with the Surface Transportation Board  STB  and the operating freight railroads  the Federal Railroad Administration  FRA  and Amtrak shall jointly develop metrics and standards for measuring the performance and service quality of intercity train operations  Such metrics and standards shall include cost recovery  on time performance  ridership per train mile  on board and station services  and the connectivity of routes  The Federal Railroad Administration shall publish a quarterly report on train performance and service quality       Route Methodology  The FRA must retain a consultant to develop and recommend objective methodologies for route and service decisions  The methodologies shall give consideration to cost recovery and on time performance of existing routes  connections with other routes  transportation needs of communities not served by other public transportation  and the methodologies used by rail service providers in other countries  Amtrak shall consider adoption of the methodologies recommended by the consultant       Access to Amtrak Equipment and Services  States wishing to use operators other than Amtrak for the provision of state supported services shall have access to Amtrak facilities for the purpose of operating that particular route       Northeast Corridor and Short Distance Routes      Northeast Corridor  Amtrak must develop a capital spending plan to return the NEC to a state of good repair by the end of 2011  The capital funds authorized in the bill are used to carry out the plan at a 100 percent Federal share  This bill establishes an advisory commission to provide advice and oversight of the NEC s operations and infrastructure  The commission members represent Amtrak  the FRA  and each State in the NEC  The commission must develop a proposal for determining the proper costs and access fees for NEC passenger and commuter trains  If Amtrak and the States fail to implement the proposal  the STB is authorized to impose restructured fees for the users of the NEC       State Supported Routes  Amtrak must develop  after consulting the States and the FRA  a uniform cost allocation methodology to assign costs and determine compensation for State supported services  Currently  States pay different rates depending on when their contracts with Amtrak were negotiated  If Amtrak and the States don t implement the proposal developed by the commission  the STB is authorized to impose restructured compensation rates       Long Distance Trains      Service Improvements  The FRA  in consultation with Amtrak  must develop system wide performance metrics for all Amtrak services in 2006 to evaluate the financial and on time performance  and customer satisfaction of each train  These metrics will be collected and published on a quarterly basis  In 2007  Amtrak is required to establish performance improvement plans for 5 long distance routes  1 3 of the 15 intercity passenger trains  with the worst performance  As Amtrak develops these plans  it must consider restructuring the route  improving on board service  changing amenities such as sleeper car service and food service  and changing the frequency of the trains  In 2008  Amtrak must implement the plans  In future years  the remaining long distance routes will undergo the same restructuring process       Competitive Bid Program  The bill establishes a competitive bid program allowing freight railroads to bid for long distance trains  FRA administers the bid process  Any employees adversely affected by the cessation of the operation of a route will either be relocated to other positions within Amtrak  provided financial incentives in exchange for the voluntarily termination of their employment  or paid termination payments guaranteed under existing collective bargaining agreements        Other Provisions      Service Improvements  The bill requires the STB to issue a quarterly on time service report  If a train s on time performance record falls below 80  for two consecutive quarters or fails to meet other requirements set by the FRA  the STB must investigate the cause  The STB then recommends to Amtrak or a freight railroad how to fix the problems that cause the service delay  If the STB determines that delays to passenger trains are the result of freight railroads not providing priority access to Amtrak  as required under law  the Board may take appropriate action to enforce priority access       Capital Grants  The bill creates a new State Capital Grant program for intercity passenger rail capital projects  The program makes grants to a State  or a group of States  to pay for the capital costs of facilities and equipment necessary to provide new or improved intercity passenger rail  The federal match is 80 percent  Projects are selected by the Secretary of Transportation based on economic feasability  expected ridership and other factors    State Rail Plans  The bill establishes a State rail planning process  New projects funded by the grant program must be on the plan        Security  The bill includes the Amtrak and passenger rail security and tunnel life safety provisions from the Rail Security Act of 2004 that passed the Senate       Bond Financing  Contains a sense of the Congress in support of multi year  predictable funding for inter city passenger rail  Reserves sections for provision in the Finance Committee s jurisdiction                      Questions or

                                                                              Bipartisan Group of Senators Call for GAO Inquiry of EPA Changes to Toxic Release Inventory Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Monday  March 27  2006      WASHINGTON  DC    In a letter sent today to the Government Accountability Office  GAO   a bipartisan group of Senators called for an investigation into the proposal by the Environmental Protection Agency s  EPA  to weaken regulations that require polluters to inform the public about toxic releases        Signing the letter sent to GAO Administrator David M  Walker were United States Senators Jim Jeffords  Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee  I VT   Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ   and Olympia Snowe  R ME        The Toxic Release Inventory  TRI  program  part of the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act  makes information about toxic releases publicly available on a neighborhood by neighborhood basis each year  Since the TRI disclosure requirement went into effect in 1988  the volume of toxic material released annually in the United States has fallen by an estimated 59 percent  Many experts believe the requirements to annually disclose the levels of released toxins into the environment were the main factor in this dramatic reduction       In September of last year  the EPA notified Congress of its intent reduce the frequency of toxics reporting from every year to every two years  At the same time  EPA initiated two additional changes that will allow thousands of facilities to withhold details about pollution volumes  waste management and treatment if they generate less than 5 000 pounds of toxic chemicals per year        The TRI program was established on the principle that the public has a right to know about chemicals that are being stored and released in their communities  The agency s proposal would curtail that right  leaving families uninformed  This is wrong  The health and safety of the American people must trump the interests of the chemical industry   said Lautenberg        Jeffords said   We know that more information leads to better decision making  Perhaps if the Bush Administration had better information about how this proposal would undermine federal  state and local government programs  they would have thought twice before going forward with such a counterproductive and unnecessary initiative         The Toxic Release Inventory provides invaluable data to the public about the release of toxic chemicals in our environment  It simply does not make sense for the EPA to alter the Toxic Release Inventory before we have an understanding of the impact these changes will have on communities throughout Maine and the country  That is why I am joining with my colleagues    Senators Lautenberg and Jeffords    in asking the GAO to fully review these changes before the EPA makes any drastic changes to the TRI   said Snowe         Concerns have been raised that  in developing these proposals  EPA s Office of Environmental Information failed to adequately consider the impact of the proposals on EPA programs  other members of the federal family  or the States   wrote the lawmakers       A copy of the letter is attached to this release       March 27  2006       Mr  David M  Walker      Comptroller General      United States Government Accountability Office      441 G Street  N W       Washington  DC 20548      Dear Mr  Walker        We write to request that the General Accountability Office examine the extent that EPA evaluated  prior to proposing various reforms to the Toxic Release Inventory  TRI  program  how the proposals would impact the use of TRI data by EPA offices  other members of the federal agencies  and the States       The TRI program  part of the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act  is often described as one of the nation s most successful environmental statutes by making information about toxic releases publicly available on a neighborhood by neighborhood basis  Since the annual disclosure requirement went into effect in 1988  the volume of toxic material released annually in the United States has fallen by an estimated 59 percent        On September 21  2005  EPA notified Congress of its intent to modify the frequency of toxics reporting from annual to biennial  At the same time  EPA initiated a separate rulemaking to  1  allow thousands of facilities to withhold details about pollution volumes  waste management and treatment if they generate less than 5 000 pounds of toxic chemicals as waste annually  and  2  reduce information collected on persistent  bio accumulative toxins generated as waste by a facility up to 500 pounds annually        Concerns have been raised that  in developing these proposals  EPA s Office of Environmental Information failed to adequately consider the impact of the proposals on EPA programs  other members of the federal family  or the States  In investigating these concerns  please evaluate whether EPA analyzed  prior to proposing the reforms  how the proposals would impact        1  EPA programs that rely on TRI data  including but not limited to        a  the Risk Screening for Environmental Indicators program  which combines TRI release data with hazard and potential exposure data       b  the hazardous air pollutant program  which tracks sources and ambient air concentrations of toxic chemicals       c  the voluntary persistent  bioaccumulative toxics tracking program  which relies on chemical specific TRI data not available through the hazardous waste program       Mr  David M  Walker      Page 2      March 28  2006       d  the enforcement program  which uses TRI data for targeting and prioritization  and       e  the environmental justice program  which relies on TRI data for evaluate potential state and local impacts        2  The ability of federal  state and local governments to provide up to date information to first responders for planning and training purposes         3  The public health uses of TRI data by federal  state and local agencies  including the Center for Disease Control  CDC  and the National Institutes of Health        4  State toxic programs  pollution prevention and compliance assistance programs         5  The availability of data concerning toxic releases not related to production activities  such as accidents  spills or periodic actions like maintenance or equipment rebuilding  currently reported as non production waste          1  The availability of toxic release data to individual communities  particularly those with only small industrial facilities  and       2  Compliance with the statutory requirement of EPCRA section 313 f  2  that reporting threshold changes maintain information on a  substantial majority  of releases for each individual chemical       We look forward to your response        Sincerely       James M  Jeffords      Ranking Member      Frank R  Lautenberg Olympia J  Snowe                       Questions or Comments

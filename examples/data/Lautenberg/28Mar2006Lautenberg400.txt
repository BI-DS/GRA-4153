Committee Subcommittee on Energy and Water and Related Agencies Washington  DC 20510      Dear Chairman Domenici and Ranking Member Reid       As you prepare to mark up HR 4939  Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense  the Global War on Terror  and Hurricane Recovery  2006  we respectfully request your consideration of funding for the Ramapo River at Oakland flood control project in the State of New Jersey  The towns of Pompton Lakes  Wayne  and Oakland  New Jersey face the possibility of catastrophic flooding this spring  including the potential for loss of life and property  if the flood protection project along the Ramapo River does not immediately receive  2 5 million  These funds will allow for the continued construction of the crucial final stage of the project  the flood control gates at the Pompton Lakes Dam        The Ramapo River at Oakland flood control project consists of two construction contracts   1  a channel modification of 5 800 feet of the Ramapo River and  2  the installation of flood control gates at the existing Pompton Lakes Dam  The channel modification contract has been completed  while the installation of the flood control gates in the Pompton Lakes Dam is in progress and slated for completion this August  Over the fiscal years between 2002 and 2004   4 5 million has been reprogrammed from the Oakland project for other priority national needs with the expectation that these funds would be restored to the project in the future  Completing the existing contract on the Pompton Lakes Dam in FY06 will require an estimated  3 8 million  but only  1 3 million was provided to the Ramapo River at Oakland flood control project in the 2006 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act  P L  109 103   An additional  2 5 million is needed to complete the Pompton Lakes contract and to prevent shutdown or termination of the contract       A shutdown or termination of the Pompton Lakes dam contract could cause a serious public safety issue  including the potential for loss of life and property  Flooding on two occasions has inundated Pompton Dam and upstream residents of Pompton Lakes  Wayne  and Oakland  New Jersey  Most recently  remnants of Tropical Storm Tammy  Hurricane Wilma  and other intermittent systems caused continual precipitation that saturated the Ramapo River Basin for most of October 2005  These events received national media coverage and highlighted the urgent need to complete the construction to provide much needed flood relief to the area        The contract for the Pompton Lakes Dam at the Ramapo River at Oakland project is set to expire on March 31  2006  If this project does not receive  2 5 million for this contract by that time  construction will be halted or even terminated  The Katrina disaster showed us first hand the tragedy that can occur with dilapidated dams and floodgates  We urge you to provide the funding for this critical project before construction is terminated

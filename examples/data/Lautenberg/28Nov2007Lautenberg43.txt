                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Contact  Lautenberg Press Office  202 224 3224 Wednesday  November 28  2007      NEWARK  N J   U S  Sen  Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ  issued the following statement at this afternoons public hearing before the federal Communications Commission on the license renewal application of WWOR TV  Channel 9     Let me welcome everyone to todays public hearing on WWOR Channel 9  We are here today because Channel 9 has failed in its responsibility to serve the people of New Jersey     Before I begin  I want to thank the people who made this hearing possible  the staff and students at Rutgers University     Also  I thank the FCC for holding this hearing in New Jersey     This is the FCCs first public hearing on a license renewal in recent memory     Renewals are typically rubber stamped  But the situation with this license warrants unprecedented attention     Thats why I asked FCC Chairman Kevin Martin to hold this hearing in our state to hear from the people of New Jersey before deciding WWORs future     Let me thank FCC Commissioners Michael Copps and Jonathan Adelstein for being here today and for working to enhance local media coverage for our state     I also want to thank todays speakers  including Voice for New Jersey  the United Church of Christ and the Rainbow PUSH Coalition and every resident of New Jersey who is here today     I thank you for making sure New Jersey is heardin this room and on our airwaves     Let me be clear about why this hearing is so important  when you pick up your remote and turn to Channel 9  you are not getting sufficient information about New Jerseys neighborhoods  roads or schools     Routinely  the news is about New York     New Jersey news is largely forgotten or buried deep into newscasts  And thats wrong     Channel 9 is licensed as a New Jersey station     Channel 9 has an obligation to cover the news that affects our communities  our businesses  and our families     In fact  the WWOR license was specifically moved from New York City to New Jersey for that very reason     The FCCs 1983 decision moving the station to New Jersey says  This station will not be a New Jersey station in name only  It will serve the people of New Jersey     Regrettably  the station has failed to meet that obligation     Leading up to the 2005 election for example  New Jersey had several important electoral races     Our residents deserved local coverage of those races to help them make informed decisions at the polls     But  remarkably  New York TV stations provided more coverage of New Jersey races than Channel 9  according to a Rutgers study     And when you look at Channel 9s Web site  it markets itself as a New York station     Its Web site is My 9 New Yorkand its Web address is my9NY com     Several years ago  WWOR closed its Trenton news bureau     What kind of coverage can we have for New Jersey families without a news team in our state capital     And three years ago  Channel 9 tried to move its news team out of our state completely     That was inexcusable  How can WWOR do its job covering our state if its not even in New Jersey     So I met with Lachlan Murdoch  then in charge of Fox Television stations  and whose father Rupert Murdoch owns News Corporation  He agreed with us to keep the news operation in New Jersey  where it remains today     That was one victory  But that is no substitute for true local coverage     New Jersey is the only state in the country without its own media market  If we had our own market  it would be the fourth largest in the country     Instead  we are wedged between New York City and Philadelphia     This makes it hard enough for our residents to get the news about our schools  our safety and our communities     We expected Channel 9 to help us overcome this problem  Thats why it was licensed in New Jersey in the first place     Instead  they have forced New Jerseys residents to tune to out of state stations     Thats simply unacceptable for the 11th largest state in the country     If the FCC renews Channel 9s license  it needs to get tough and make certain that New Jersey gets the news coverage it needs and deserves     The FCC must require Channel 9 to meet specific  measurable goals for its New Jersey coverage     WWOR must identify itself as a New Jersey station     It must devote a specific and substantial amount of air time each week to New Jersey news stories and events     It must document its New Jersey coverage in a separate FCC report  The report should show date  time of day  duration and content in detail     And it must keep its news department and production studios in New Jersey     When the FCC moved Channel 9 from New York to New Jersey  it said  At renewal time  it will be judged by how it has met the obligation to serve the needs of Northern New Jersey     Its now renewal time  and the facts are clear  Channel 9 has failed our state     Channel 9 is based in New Jersey  Its time for the FCC to make sure it covers New Jersey                          Questions or Comments

     Senator Frank R  Lautenberg                                                                                                                      Press Release        of        Senator Lautenberg                                                                                Lautenberg Urges Federal Agencies to Expand Testing and Monitoring of NJ Children and Families Exposed to Mercury                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Tuesday  August 29  2006          NEWARK  N J      Today  United States Senator Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ  called on both the Centers for Disease Control  CDC  and the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  to test the homes of families and expand the testing and monitoring of children who were exposed to mercury while attending the Kiddie Kollege day care in Franklin Township       The day care facility was closed down on July 28  2006 due to extremely high levels of mercury vapor   This day care center was apparently built on top of a now closed thermometer factory         The health and safety of New Jersey  s children is priority number one  and the federal government must do all it can to ensure those children who may have been exposed get the best possible care     said Senator Lautenberg  who wrote letters to the Director of the CDC as well the EPA Regional Administrator       In his letter to the head of the CDC  Lautenberg asked the agency to expand conditional testing and monitoring of all children and adults who were exposed to mercury  Currently  the CDC will only continue to test those that have above 5 micrograms of mercury per gram of creatinine        Parents have expressed serious concern that there may be mercury in their homes   Therefore Lautenberg urged the EPA to immediately offer to test the homes of any parents who had children attending the Kiddie Kollege facility for mercury contamination       Both letters are attached to this release       August 29  2006        Regional Administrator Alan Steinberg   US EPA Region II  290 Broadway  NY  NY  10007          Dear Administrator Steinberg       I am writing to urge your agency  s immediate assistance regarding the Kiddie College day care center in Franklin Township  New Jersey         As you are aware  this day care facility was closed down on July 28  2006 due to extremely high levels of mercury vapor   This day care center was apparently built on top of a now closed thermometer factory and clearly should never have been allowed to open and operate   The NJ DEP  property owners  Franklin Township officials and others are attempting to determine how this situation occurred          Early on  no one knew what was happening at Kiddie College and parents saw little cause for alarm   Then the parents of one child who attended the day care center discovered mercury on their daughter s backpack   As you know  mercury exposure and contamination is serious and can result in numerous and significant health effects   Since this incident  these same parents expressed a concern that more mercury may be present in their home or in the homes of other families           Sixty nine children and nine adults were then tested for mercury poisoning by the Centers for Disease Control and about one third of them will require additional monitoring and testing due to mercury levels of concern   This situation is untenable for the parents who entrusted their childrens safety to Kiddie College  They worry about the possible health effects  both short and long term  which mercury exposure could have on their small children         Parents have expressed a very real concern that there may be more mercury in their home or in the homes of other parents due to direct contact with their children   As you know  mercury is difficult for everyday people to detect  and exposure and contamination is an extremely serious health risk which can result in numerous significant health effects          I am therefore writing to urge that your agency immediately offer to test the homes for mercury contamination  of any parents who had children attending the Kiddie Kollege facility   Given the above information  it is entirely possible that children may have been bringing mercury into their homes and that it may still be present there   With everything these parents have had to endure recently  it is important to give them peace of mind that their family does not continue to be exposed to mercury in their own home         Thank you for your review of this important matter   I would appreciate your immediate response          Sincerely       Frank R  Lautenberg  U S  Senate       August 29  2006      Dr  Julie Gerberding  Director  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  1600 Clifton Road NE  Atlanta  GA 30333            Dear Dr  Gerberding       I am writing to request important additional assistance from the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry  ATSDR  regarding the Kiddie College day care center in Franklin Township  New Jersey   Specifically  I am urging you to continue testing and monitoring for all children and adults affected by this traumatic situation  not just those who originally tested above 5 micrograms of mercury per gram of creatinine         As you are aware  this day care facility was closed down on July 28  2006 due to extremely high levels of mercury vapor   This day care center was apparently built on top of a now closed thermometer factory and clearly should never have been allowed to open and operate           From the beginning  ATSDR has been very responsive to the concerns of the community and of the parents   I understand that your agency has participated in two community briefings to educate the parents on the current situation of mercury exposure  the possible health effects on their children and to assist them with the urine testing process and explain the results         As you know  69 children and 9 adults were tested for mercury exposure by the Centers for Disease Control   I understand that about 2 3 of those tested had levels below your cutoff of 5 micrograms of mercury per gram of creatinine and will not receive further testing by your agency          I have been contacted by concerned parents of a child who attended Kiddie Kollege and whose test results fall below the cutoff for additional testing   While they are certainly relieved that her levels are below your cutoff  they remain very concerned about the possible health effects that mercury exposure could have on their young child   They have requested assistance in obtaining additional testing for their child  to ensure that she does not face short or long term health effects         As you can imagine  this situation has been extremely traumatic for both the parents and children   Given the circumstances  I would urge your agency to conduct additional testing and monitoring for the children and adults below the 5 micrograms level   These parents have certainly earned the right to feel that everything possible is being done to monitor the health of their children         Thank you again for your agency  s actions to date   I would appreciate your immediate response to this request       Sincerely       Frank R  Lautenberg                     Questions or Comments

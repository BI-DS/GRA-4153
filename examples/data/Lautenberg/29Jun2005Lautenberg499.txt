and false statements  United States Senators Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ  and Harry S  Reid  D NV  asked the Government Accountability Office  GAO  to determine the legality of actions taken by a former top Bush administration official who altered government scientific reports on global warming       A former lobbyist for the American Petroleum Institute  API   Philip Cooney  was hired by President Bush as Chief of Staff of the White House s Council on Environmental Quality  CEQ  in 2001  He recently resigned his post to join ExxonMobil Corporation        Since the altered reports were requested by  and directed to  Congress  and were prepared by departments and agencies of the U S  Government  we are seeking your legal evaluation of whether Mr  Cooney s actions violated two laws   wrote the lawmakers in their letter to Comptroller General David Walker  The specific laws are highlighted in detail in the letter        These alterations have severely harmed the integrity of U S  Government scientific analyses  and the taxpayers who foot the bill for these doctored reports  We look forward to your analysis of the legality of these actions by Mr  Cooney   concluded Lautenberg and Reid in their letter to Walker       In addition  Lautenberg and Reid also wrote to the Director of the U S  Climate Change Science Program  Dr  James R  Mahoney calling on him to immediately retract both of the reports edited by Mr  Cooney until the GAO concludes its investigation        Government reports must be based on science  not science fiction   said Lautenberg   The Bush administration cannot  fix  science around their political goals         Phil Cooney s altering of scientific reports is yet another disturbing case of this administration abusing its power to serve radical  rightwing special interests   said Senator Reid   Congress and the American people need to be able to trust that scientific reports are based on science  not the partisan agenda of the current administration

Philip Cooney  a lawyer with no scientific training  significantly altered the scientific conclusions of at least two studies commissioned by Congress  The reports Mr  Cooney altered were       1  U S

Corporation this fall  Prior to his employment at the White House  Mr  Cooney was a lobbyist for the American Petroleum Institute  API   Both ExxonMobil and the API are leading opponents of policies to prevent global warming       Since the altered reports were requested by  and directed to  Congress  and were prepared by departments and agencies of the U S  Government  We are seeking your legal

Warming will also cause reductions in mountain glaciers and advance the timing of the melt of mountain snow packs in polar regions  In turn  runoff rates will change and flood potential will be altered in ways that are currently not well understood  There will be significant shifts in the seasonality of runoff that will have serious impacts on native populations that rely on fishing and hunting for their livelihood  These changes will be further complicated by shifts in precipitation regimes and a possible intensification and increased frequency of extreme hydrologic events   Entire

Program National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Department of Commerce Washington  DC 20006      Dear Dr  Mahoney       We are writing to inform you that we have written to the Government Accountability Office  GAO  today to request a determination of the legality of conduct surrounding the alteration of two reports published by your program  Our Changing Planet  The Fiscal Year 2003 U S  Global Change Research Program and the 2003 Strategic Plan for the U S  Climate Change Science Program  We request that you immediately retract these reports until the GAO has determined the legal status of these documents       It has become clear that Philip A  Cooney  the former Chief of Staff of the White House Council on Environmental Quality  a lawyer with no scientific training  substantially altered the scientific meaning of your reports  White House officials are entitled to make policy  but they are not entitled to change the clear meaning of scientific documents  This conduct may very well violate two Federal laws  18 U S C       1505  Obstruction of Proceedings before Departments  Agencies  and Committee and 18 U S C       1001  Statements or Entries Generally       In addition to the two reports cited above  we urge you to retract all other climate change reports to Congress altered by Mr  Cooney and remove them from your program s website        Sincerely

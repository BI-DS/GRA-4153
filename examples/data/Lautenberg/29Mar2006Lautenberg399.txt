of climate change from being altered by White House political aides  several members of the United States Senate called for all future reports to be audited by the National Academy of Sciences  NAS         Senators Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ   Daniel K  Inouye  D HI  and John F  Kerry  D MA  in a letter sent today  urged the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere and Deputy Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration James R  Mahoney  Ph D  to put in place procedures that would give the NAS oversight for future scientific reports  including the annual  Our Changing Planet  report        Political appointees in the Bush administration have altered the robust scientific findings of several Climate Change Science Program  CCSP  reports  Those alterations have injected expressions of uncertainty about aspects of climate change where none was intended by the authors  The lawmakers took this action today because the CCSP will begin the task of preparing the  Our Changing Planet  reports for Fiscal Year 2007 and Fiscal Year 2008        We are writing specifically to request that you empower the National Academy of Sciences  NAS  with an oversight and auditing role in the preparation of the upcoming  Our Changing Planet  report      Global warming is one of the most serious challenges we face  and Congress mandated reports summarizing the results of federal climate research to provide a solid scientific basis for public policy  Political interference has now tainted these reports and diminished their usefulness to Congress and the American people   the lawmakers wrote       A copy of the letter is attached to the release       The Honorable James R  Mahoney  Ph D  Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere   Deputy Administrator  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration U S  Department of Commerce Washington  DC 20230       Dear Dr  Mahoney       As you are well aware  the annual  Our Changing Planet  report and other federal climate science reports have been tainted by allegations of political interference and altered scientific findings in recent years  As you and the Climate Change Science Program  CCSP  begin the task of preparing the  Our Changing Planet  reports for Fiscal Year 2007 and Fiscal Year 2008    and any other reports that synthesize or summarize the results of federal climate science    we are writing to urge you to take immediate  extraordinary steps to repair public confidence in these reports and protect their scientific integrity        In particular  the Fiscal Year 2003 edition of the annual  Our Changing Planet  climate change report and the 2003  Strategic Plan for the United States Climate Change Science Program  were tainted by allegations of political interference and editing that altered those reports  robust scientific findings       We are writing specifically to request that you empower the National Academy of Sciences  NAS  with an oversight and auditing role in the preparation of the upcoming  Our Changing Planet  report  The NAS could certify to the public that the final version of the Fiscal Year 2007 report accurately reflects scientific findings  not political wishful thinking  We also ask that you provide NAS a similar certification role for other climate science reports intended for use by decision makers       Global warming is one of the most serious challenges we face  and Congress mandated reports summarizing the results of federal climate research to provide a solid scientific basis for public policy  Political interference has now tainted these reports and diminished their usefulness to Congress and the American people       Although you are leaving your position soon  we hope you will not delay in making the changes necessary to restore the integrity and reputation of the CCSP        Our nation cannot afford to have a political cloud over government sponsored scientific research  The NAS can play a critical role in maintaining the high level of independence and integrity that we expect from federally supported science  so we can make the best decisions to protect current and future generations of Americans       Sincerely       Frank R  Lautenberg Daniel K  Inouye John F  Kerry                   Questions or Comments

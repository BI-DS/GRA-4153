Bush Administration political appointees blocked the publication of scientific research regarding global warming and its relationship to increased intensity of hurricanes  a group of Democratic lawmakers led by United States Senator Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ  called on the Inspector Generals of both the Commerce Department and NASA to launch formal investigations         We are deeply

published  disseminated and debated  rather than suppressed because it does not support the stated positions of the administration     the lawmakers stated in their letter    Unfortunately  this recent incident seems to be only the latest in a growing list of actions taken by this administration to conceal legitimate and scientifically sound findings that do not fit the President  s stated ideological preferences            Earlier this month  it was reported that last October  political appointees at NOAA barred a staff scientist  Thomas Knutson  from speaking with reporters because he has published studies which link global warming and hurricane strength   In January  NASA prevented James E  Hansen  director of its Goddard Institute for Space Studies  from speaking to the media

Space Administration 1401 Constitution Ave   NW   300 E St   SW  Washington  DC 20230   Washington  DC 20546     Dear Inspectors General Frazier and Cobb       We write to you today to request a formal investigation into continuing reports of political interference with the work of scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  NASA  and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  NOAA   We are deeply disturbed by what appears to be repeated instances of scientists at these agencies having publication of their research and access to the media blocked  solely based upon their views and conclusions regarding the reality and impacts of global warming        Most recently  there have been reports that political appointees at the Department of Commerce blocked the publication of legitimate scientific research by climate change experts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration   The report in question detailed the link between global warming and increased hurricane intensity and strength   Given the catastrophic destruction caused by hurricanes like Katrina  Rita and Ivan in recent years  and the administration  s continuing refusal to support mandatory controls on greenhouse gas emissions  this topic could not be more timely   A draft copy of the report obtained by Nature magazine posits that there may indeed be a link between global warming and hurricane strength  and recommends further research and study into the matter   We strongly believe that research paid for with taxpayer funds should be published  disseminated and debated  rather than suppressed because it does not support the stated positions of the administration       Unfortunately  this recent incident seems to be only the latest in a growing list of actions taken by this administration to conceal legitimate and scientifically sound findings that do not fit the President  s stated ideological preferences   Earlier this month  it was reported that last October  political appointees at NOAA barred a staff scientist  Thomas Knutson  from speaking with reporters because he has published studies which link global warming and hurricane strength   In December of 2005  NASA prevented James E  Hansen  director of its Goddard Institute for Space Studies  from speaking to the media after he delivered a scholarly lecture in which he concluded that greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced in order to slow global warming   Furthermore  in April  staff scientists and contractors at NOAA interviewed by the Washington Post disclosed that   administration officials have chastised them for speaking on policy questions  removed references to global warming from their reports  news releases and conference Web sites  investigated news leaks  and sometimes urged them to stop speaking to the media altogether           These activities do a disservice to the American public and are delaying a rational and comprehensive response to the very grave and real threat of global warming   Most recently  a peer reviewed study concluded that   the Western Pacific    and probably the planet as a whole  is    within approximately one degree Celsius of the maximum temperature of the past million years          In light of these and other troubling reports  we respectfully request that your office conduct a full and thorough investigation into the suppression of science and censorship of scientists at these government agencies                          Questions or Comments

     Senator Frank R  Lautenberg                                                                                                                      Press Release        of        Senator Lautenberg                                                                                Statement by Senator Lautenberg on the Nomination of Samuel A  Alito to the Supreme Court                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Remarks Delivered from the Floor of the Senate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Monday  January 30  2006      Mr  President  I rise to discuss the President s nomination of Samuel A  Alito  Jr  to the Supreme Court of the United States       It s no secret that Judge Alito is from my home state and I was honored to introduce him to the Judiciary Committee  I talked with him privately in my office  He is an accomplished jurist from a distinguished family in my state        At the hearing  our colleague from Pennsylvania  Chairman Specter  asked me if I was endorsing Judge Alito for this position       I told him that I am just presenting evidence to the committee  and I will let the record speak for itself       I wasn t going to make any prejudgments  I wanted to hear from Judge Alito  I wanted to listen to his answers to my colleagues  questions       Mr  President  this nomination    as all are when it comes to the Supreme Court    is an incredibly important moment for our nation  Particularly because Judge Alito has been nominated to replace Justice Sandra Day O Connor       Justice O Connor  over the past 25 years  has proven that she is not a ideologically conservative justice or a liberal justice  She has not brought an agenda to the court       That is why Justice O Connor has been a swing vote    because she always studied the facts and the law and tried to apply them fairly  I didn t always agree with her  but like many Americans  I knew she came at these legal questions fairly and with an open mind       She showed respect for precedent  She put the law above her personal beliefs  In my view  it is critical that we replace Justice O Connor with someone who shares her open minded approach of looking at the law and the facts  with no political agenda  Even the mere threat of legal activism on this Supreme Court threatens the future of this country  and the rights of our children  our grandchildren and other future generations       Many legal experts     judges  lawyers  and professors have contacted me regarding this nomination  Some supported him  some opposed him  Many of these experts tried to convince me one way or the other        But when I listened to Judge Alito s hearings in the Judiciary Committee  I listened with the faces of my grandchildren in my mind  and with thoughts of ordinary people who depend on the fairness of our society        I was applying Judge Alito s philosophy to the real problems everyday people    in New Jersey and across the nation    face       I often hear many concerns from my constituents about how powerless they feel in the face of insurance companies that are often indifferent to their plight or as an employee unfairly treated in the workplace       What rights do everyday Americans have in the face of giant corporations or unchecked government power       At the hearings  it was clear that Judge Alito almost always lined up against the  little guy  and with the big corporations and government       In fact  a Knight Ridder study of Judge Alito s rulings showed that he  seldom sided with     an employee alleging discrimination or consumers suing big business         A Washington Post analysis of all divided opinions on the Third Circuit involving Judge Alito found that he  has sided against three of every four people who claimed to have been victims of discrimination  and  routinely    defers to government officials and others in position of authority         Let me cite two examples        In Bray v  Marriott  an African American hotel worker in Park Ridge  New Jersey alleged discrimination against her employer  The Third Circuit ruled that she deserved her day in court because there was enough evidence of discrimination  But Judge Alito dissented  citing concerns about the cost of trials to employers  The other judges in the case criticized Judge Alito s dissent  saying that if it were the law  then the employment discrimination laws would have no real effect       In another case  Sheridan v  Dupont  Judge Alito was the only judge of eleven judges who heard the case to find against a woman s claim of gender discrimination  Judge Alito stated that the alleged victim shouldn t even get a trial  The other judges were so distressed by Judge Alito s decision that they said    QUOTE     the judicial system has little to gain by Judge Alito s approach        So if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court  will Judge Alito make it more difficult for everyday people to protect themselves and their families against the power of big business and unchecked government  Unfortunately  it appears almost certain       Regarding individual rights  there was a very disturbing exchange in the hearing involving the Constitutional right to reproductive choice        Senator Durbin asked Judge Alito if he would agree with Chief Justice Roberts  statement that the right to choose is  settled law   It seems to me that it was a  no brainer     of course it is settled law  It has been on the books for 33 years and upheld 38 times  You don t have to go to law school to figure that one out       But Judge Alito refused to say it was  settled law   To me it was a telling moment in the hearings       Mr  President  I am not a lawyer  but I understand this  the right to choose is settled law        Judge Alito s refusal to acknowledge that the right to choose is settled law  indicates to me that  even before he sits on the Supreme Court  he intends to overturn Roe v  Wade       For everyday New Jerseyans  especially our state s women  that would be the realization of a nightmare  We do not want to turn back the clock on women s rights  Even if abortions become illegal  they will still happen    but largely in unsafe conditions  It s a nightmare that I do not want to risk happening       Then there is the issue of abuse of power and the power of the Presidency       Growing up in New Jersey  it is clear that our state is proud of our role in the American War for Independence  More battles of the Revolutionary War were fought in New Jersey than in any other state  The most famous image of that war is George Washington crossing the Delaware River at Trenton       New Jersey is a state of immigrants  Many New Jerseyans came to America to escape kings  despots and dictators  So we understand why we fought the War of Independence to get rid of King George       America doesn t want a king or an  imperial President   Neither does New Jersey  That s why we have three co equal branches of government       So when Judge Alito talked about his theory of a  unitary executive     a President above the other two branches of government    I found that very troubling       The Father of our nation  George Washington  warned the American people about allowing a leader to claim too much power  In his farewell address to the nation  Washington indicated his concern about the Presidency becoming too powerful        He said we should avoid allowing    QUOTE        T he exercise of the powers of one department to encroach upon another  The spirit of encroachment tends to consolidate the powers of all the departments in one  and thus to create  whatever the form of government  a real despotism       Those are Washington s words  But they have a real resonance today        The current Administration claims a power beyond the laws that Congress has set  It is an Administration that believes it can spy on Americans without a warrant  despite specific laws to the contrary  These are the kinds of abuses that caused the citizens of New Jersey and the other American colonies to rise up against King George       Mr  President  we don t want a King  And we don t want to create a Supreme Court that will crown this President    or any future President    Republican or Democratic        The question before us is not a generic question of whether Judge Alito is qualified for the Supreme Court  The real question is whether Judge Alito is the right person for this seat on the Supreme Court  The seat at issue is Sandra Day O Connor s seat  It is a seat held by a middle of the road  balanced justice       As I noted during my testimony introducing Judge Alito to the Judiciary Committee  he is a young man  If the Senate confirms him for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court  he might serve for three decades    or even longer  His decisions would affect not only our rights  but also the rights of our children  our grandchildren and other future generations        That s why  after careful consideration and deliberation  I have decided to vote no on the confirmation of Judge Alito  He is a good  decent man    an ethical man  I do not think he subscribes to any bigoted views  But I believe there is a grave risk that he carries a legal agenda with him  one that he will bring to the Supreme Court       While there will be law professors and others who will disagree with my analysis  as I said before  I am more concerned about the effect of this nomination on everyday people in New Jersey and across the nation       I am proud there is a Federal Courthouse in Newark named after me  I asked that an inscription be placed on the walls of that courthouse  It reads   The true measure of a democracy is its dispensation of justice         I believe in that quote  It guides me today        So for the parents fighting an insurance company for access to health care for their child  For the blue collar worker facing harassment in the workplace  For the women who want the government s hands off their body  For everyday people  I will oppose this nomination       I yield the floor                        Questions or Comments

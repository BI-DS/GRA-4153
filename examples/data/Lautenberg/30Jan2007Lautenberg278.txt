                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Letter to PBGC asks Agency to Consider Restoring U S  Airways Employee Pension Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Tuesday  January 30  2007                     WASHINGTON  D C    Last night  United States Senator Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ   along with a bipartisan group of his colleagues  sent a letter to the head of the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation  PBGC   asking him to explore the possibility of restoring the terminated employee pension programs at U S  Airways  in light of the airline  s substantially improved financial circumstances   The employee pension plans  which were under funded by  4 8 billion at the time of their termination  have since been assumed by the PBGC                     By law  PBGC has the authority to take such action if a company  s financial situation is improved   Earlier this month  US Airways offered to purchase the larger Delta Airlines for some  10 2 billion  including  5 billion in cash           If US Airways now clearly has ability to generate considerable cash and has easy access to credit markets  the company  s ability to restore its terminated pension plans must be fully explored   This is especially true in light of the fact that PBGC regulations would permit the restored plans to be funded over a period of up to 30 years  which is an even longer funding period than airlines are afforded under the Pension Protection Act of 2006     the lawmakers wrote           The Federal government shouldn  t allow a company that dumped its pension responsibilities buy another     said Lautenberg    US Airways should take care of its employees before taking over another airline            Senators Johnny Isakson  R GA   Maria Cantwell  D WA   Saxby Chambliss  R GA   and Patty Murray  D WA  also joined Lautenberg in signing the letter        The full text of the letter follows          January 29  2007       Vincent K  Snowbarger      Interim Director      Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation      1200 K Street  N W       Washington  DC 20005 4026       Dear Mr  Snowbarger       We write to request that you evaluate restoring the employee pension plans of US Airways in light of the substantially improved financial position of the company   These employee pension programs were terminated over the last several years as a means of improving the survivability of the airline  but the airline is in a much different position today         We understand that the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation  PBGC  has authority to restore a terminated pension plan when appropriate and consistent with Employee Retirement Income Security Act  ERISA    Furthermore  we understand that   improved financial circumstances    of a company is a key basis for restoration of a terminated pension plan         It is apparent that US Airways  financial circumstances have greatly improved since it terminated its pension plans with estimated unfunded liabilities of approximately  4 8 billion   US Airways has reported a profit of  292 million through the first three quarters of 2006  versus a  276 million loss for the first three quarters of 2005    Also  as of the end of the third quarter of 2006  US Airways reported cash and investments of approximately  3 billion         In addition  US Airways has offered to pay  10 2 billion   including  5 billion of cash   to buy the much larger Delta Air Lines  further demonstrating US Airways  ability to bear the cost of its terminated pension plans   Indeed  it is striking that the  5 billion in cash being offered as part of the hostile Delta offer exceeds the full amount of the unfunded liabilities recently transferred to the PBGC   Certainly  neither the PBGC  other employers paying premiums to the PBGC  innocent pensioners  nor taxpayers should bear billions in costs to enable companies to buy out their competitors         If US Airways now clearly has ability to generate considerable cash and has easy access to credit markets  the company  s ability to restore its terminated pension plans must be fully explored   This is especially true in light of the fact that PBGC regulations would permit the restored plans to be funded over a period of up to 30 years  which is an even longer funding period than airlines are afforded under the Pension Protection Act of 2006        For these reasons  we request that the PBGC explore restoration of US Airways  terminated employee pension plans         Sincerely       Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ   Johnny Isakson  R GA   Maria Cantwell  D WA   Saxby Chambliss  R GA   and Patty Murray  D WA                      Questions or Comments

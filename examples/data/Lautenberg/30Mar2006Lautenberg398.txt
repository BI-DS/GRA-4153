                                                                              Action Comes on Heels of Hollow Proposal by Bush Administration                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Thursday  March 30  2006      WASHINGTON  D C     A group of U S  Senators today introduced a far reaching  comprehensive plan to protect the nation s chemical plants from terrorist attacks  following a weak proposal offered last week by the Bush Administration that would continue to leave millions of Americans at serious risk  United States Senators Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ  and Barack Obama  D IL  authored the Chemical Security and Safety Act  which is cosponsored by Senators John F  Kerry  D MA   Robert Menendez  D NJ   Richard J  Durbin  D IL  and Joe Biden  D DE        The Lautenberg Obama bill goes farther to protect communities than any other proposal by requiring companies to use safer chemicals whenever possible  a practice known as Inherently Safe Technology  IST   The measure will also require larger perimeter barriers around chemical plants  protect the rights of states to enact tougher chemical security standards  establish whistleblower protections for employees who expose security risks at chemical facilities  and guarantee that workers have a role in securing the safety of facilities       The Bush administration s proposal outlined last week by Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff  calls for state laws to be nullified and rejects the use of Inherently Safe Technology        In a nutshell  the Bush Administration s approach is  trust the chemical industry    they ll do the right thing   It didn t work with Enron and it won t work here   said Senator Lautenberg   An attack on chemical plants would threaten millions of Americans and President Bush responds to the threat with a hollow proposal  This incompetence by the Bush administration cannot be allowed to continue         There may be no greater failure of our government than the fact that we have done almost nothing to secure one of America s most vulnerable targets   the 15 000 chemical plants in America   said Obama   These chemical plants represent some of the most attractive targets for terrorists looking to cause widespread death and destruction  Unfortunately  at many of the chemical plants in our nation  the security is light  the facilities are easily entered  and the contents are deadly         The Administration s plan to outsource our ports was the tip of the iceberg   said Senator Kerry   There are chemical plants in cities and towns all across America but the Bush White House has consistently bowed to pressure from industry  backing away from and even aggressively blocking regulations to beef up security  That s a disgrace  Surely we can put these common sense measures in place to keep our families and our communities safe          We cannot afford to wait another day to strengthen security at the chemical plants that dot our state  These plants pose a risk to millions of New Jerseyans  and it is long past time for the federal government to implement strict measures to make them safer   said Senator Menendez         Chemical plant security is a serious problem and the combination of lax security and deadly chemicals is a toxic mix   said Durbin   Illinois has more facilities that store extremely hazardous materials then any other state  with over 100 000 pounds of hazardous substances stored in over 600 facilities  We need a new direction for security in this country  one that includes creating tough  enforceable standards for chemical plant security          Chemical plants are a top target for terrorists  Many of the nation s largest chemical facilities are located in places where a toxic release could injure or kill tens of thousands of people   said Biden   The Department of Homeland Security should not abdicate responsibility for chemical plant security to the chemical industry  We should set national standards for securing chemical plants and take immediate steps to safeguard the most vulnerable facilities        There are about 15 000 chemical manufacturers and storage facilities nationwide by one count  including about 110 in heavily populated areas        The greatest  zone of vulnerability  in the U S  is in South Kearney  NJ  where 12 million people live in proximity to the Kuehne Chemical plant  An explosion at the facility would endanger the life and health of people caught in the path of the prevailing winds  Chemical security presents one of the biggest domestic threats in the U S  Richard Falkenrath  a former top presidential advisor on homeland security  has said   I am aware of no other category of potential terrorist targets that presents as great a danger         A fact sheet on the Lautenberg Obama Chemical Security and Safety Act is attached to this release       Lautenberg Obama The Chemical Security and Safety Act      The Lautenberg Obama bill does the following       Requires the use of safer chemicals when possible  which is commonly referred to as  Inherently Safe Technology  or IST       Protects state authority to adopt stronger protections than federal law        Improves site security to the maximum extent possible        Guarantees that workers have a role ensuring the security and safety of facilities        Provides strong protection for whistleblowers        Ensures a role for EPA administrator  and agency expertise  in oversight of chemical facilities       Protects security information from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and other state or local disclosure laws                        Questions or Comments

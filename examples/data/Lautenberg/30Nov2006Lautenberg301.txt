                                                                               Contact  Alex Formuzis  202  224 7340 Thursday  November 30  2006         WASHINGTON  D C      After pressure from United States Senators Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ  and Robert Menendez  D NJ   the head of the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  agreed to partially reverse its plans to gut the Right to Know law that provides communities with information about potentially dangerous chemicals in their area  The lawmakers called the action a small step forward  but pledged to push legislation early next year that would stop the entire anti environment  pro polluter Bush plan from moving forward  Lautenberg wrote the Chemical Right To Know law back in 1986 in the aftermath of a 1984 chemical disaster in Bhopal  India that killed thousands       Lautenberg received a letter from EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson this week stating his intention not to move forward with a proposal to allow companies releasing chemicals to report every two years  instead of every year          It is welcome news that the Bush Administration is throwing out part of this bad idea  but they still need to get rid of the rest  The Administration  s proposed changes to the Right to Know Law would essentially gut it   The Administration  s proposed changes are nothing more than a giveaway to corporate polluters at the cost of everyday Americans   health  The Democratic Congress is not going to let this kind of irresponsible policy stand   The wise course for the Bush Administration is to drop this entire pro polluter plan     said Senator Lautenberg        The Bush administration is finally starting to get the point that Senator Lautenberg and I will not stand down when it comes to protecting New Jersey and American families from dangerous pollutants     Menendez said    While the Bush administration is starting to get religion  they haven  t fully converted and are continuing their sacrilegious plan to render Right to Know laws impotent  Therefore  Senator Lautenberg and I will make them true believers by introducing legislation to reverse their hazardous plans to keep Americans in the dark         In addition to altering the frequency of reporting requirements  EPA has proposed allowing chemical facilities to release 10 times more pollution than these facilities can release right now without publicly reporting the releases   Currently  facilities can only release 500 pounds of pollution before having the disclose the information  but the Bush administration has proposed allowing these facilities to release up to 5 000 pounds of pollution before being required to report the details to the public       Under the Bush proposal people will lose information about toxic chemicals at thousands of facilities released or stored in their communities  The Bush plan would also eliminate reporting requirements of toxic chemical releases from 6 200 facilities nationwide  160 in New Jersey   1 360 of those facilities  31 in New Jersey  release chemicals that are classified as known or likely carcinogens      The Toxics Release Inventory  TRI  was established as part of the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act in 1986  which Lautenberg authored   The program requires owners of facilities to report annually on the amount of toxic chemicals that have been released into the air  water or land   These facilities are also required to report how they dispose of chemicals that are not released to the environment  for example that are shipped offsite for treatment and disposal   or that are treated  recycled or otherwise managed at the facility       The legislation Lautenberg and Menendez plan to introduce next week will prevent EPA from making any additional attempts to change the frequency of reporting toxic releases  In addition  the measure will prohibit EPA from adopting any of the other changes to the Toxics Release Inventory that the agency has proposed  and stop EPA from shielding information on the use or release of persistent chemicals such as lead and mercury                                 Questions or Comments

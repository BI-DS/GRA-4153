introduced legislation that would trigger a reconsideration of major base closings that will cost far more than what was estimated during the Pentagons Base Realignment and Closure  BRAC  process  Sens  Robert Menendez  D NJ  and Frank Lautenberg  D NJ  are keenly aware of some of the wildly inaccurate cost estimates used in the BRAC process  since the closing of New Jerseys Fort Monmouth is now expected to cost almost twice its original  780 million price tag   The point of this process was to reduce costs  but now the price tag for some of these base closings is ballooning out of control and taxpayers are the ones carrying the burden  said Menendez  If taxpayers are being forced to foot an enormous bill they werent expecting  there should be an escape hatch  In New Jersey  we have communities and families that will be greatly impacted by the closing of Fort Monmouth  Knowing that the decision was based on miscalculations and misinformation does not sit well with our state  and it should not sit well with taxpayers across the country either   This bill would require real accountability and transparency in the base closure process  It would ensure that excessive cost overruns in closing a base like Fort Monmouth never happen again  It would also provide a method to review the closure of Fort Monmouth so that we can reevaluate the decision to close the base that was based upon faulty information  I look forward to working to get this legislation enacted into law  said Sen  Lautenberg   Menendez Lautenberg BRAC Cost Overruns Protection Act of 2007  BRAC COP Act of 2007   Summary  The point of the BRAC process is to reduce costs  But the cost of BRAC has ballooned out of control  from the BRAC Commissions original  one time implementation cost estimate of  21 billion to a current price tag of  30 billion  a 43  increase  The Menendez legislation simply tries to control these excessive costs and ensure that BRAC is maximizing our tax payers money  The legislation works from a basic principle  already in existing law  that we need to take another look if the costs have increased by more than 25 percent   Details   The legislation is based on principles found in existing law concerning cost overruns in weapons programs  known as the Nunn McCurdy amendment   The Nunn McCurdy amendment was included in the Fiscal Year 1982 Defense Authorization Act       The Menendez legislation will create a trigger mechanism to require a re evaluation of any major base realignment or closure should the actual cost exceed BRACs estimated cost by more than 25 percent     How the trigger mechanism is designed    1  The Secretary of Defense will write biannual reports on the cost of implementing the pending base closure or realignment recommendations mandated by BRAC law     2  If the Secretary determines that the actual cost of implementing a major base closure or realignment recommendation has exceeded the original cost estimate   which was the basis for the law passed by Congress   by more than 25 percent  the Secretary shall   a   notify the Chairman and Ranking Member of Congressional Defense Committees  b   devise a business plan to reduce the cost of the base closure or  realignment  without re adjusting the baseline estimated cost  so that it does not exceed a 25 percent increase   3  Within 45 days  the Secretary of Defense will submit a recommendation to the President on whether to continue the base closure or realignment     4  Within 30 days of receiving the Secretarys recommendation  the President will make a recommendation to Congress on whether to continue the base closure or realignment     5  Congress has the option to vote to disapprove the Presidents recommendation     If the Secretary of Defense recommends that the President continue or modify the base closure or realignment  despite the excessive cost overruns  the Secretary must include in his recommendation to the President an explanation of why it is necessary to continue implementing the recommendation   The term major base closure and realignment shall include any base cloture and or realignment that requires  150 million or more in military construction costs and an overall  one time implementation cost of  300 million or more                           Questions or Comments

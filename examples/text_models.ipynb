letter to the head of the pension benefit guarantee corporation  pbgc   asking him to explore the possibility of restoring the terminated employee pension programs at u s  airways  in light of the airline  s substantially improved financial circumstances   the employee pension plans  which were under funded by  4 8 billion at the time of their termination  have since been assumed by the pbgc                     by law  pbgc has the authority to take such action if a company  s financial situation is improved   earlier this month  us airways offered to purchase the larger delta airlines for some  10 2 billion  including  5 billion in cash           if us airways now clearly has ability to generate considerable cash and has easy access to credit markets  the company  s ability to restore its terminated pension plans must be fully explored   this is especially true in light of the fact that pbgc regulations would permit the restored plans to be funded over a period of up to 30 years  which is an even longer funding period than airlines are afforded under the pension protection act of 2006     the lawmakers wrote           the federal government shouldn  t allow a company that dumped its pension responsibilities buy another     said lautenberg    us airways should take care of its employees before taking over another airline            senators johnny isakson  r ga   maria

restoring the employee pension plans of us airways in light of the substantially improved financial position of the company   these employee pension programs were terminated over the last several years as a means of improving the survivability of the airline  but the airline is in a much different position today         we understand that the pension benefit guarantee corporation  pbgc  has authority to restore a terminated pension plan when appropriate and consistent with employee retirement income security act  erisa    furthermore  we understand that   improved financial circumstances    of a company is a key basis for restoration of a terminated pension plan         it is apparent that us airways  financial circumstances have greatly improved since it terminated its pension plans with estimated unfunded liabilities of approximately  4 8 billion   us airways has reported a profit of  292 million through the first three quarters of 2006  versus a  276 million loss for the first three quarters of 2005    also  as of the end of the third quarter of 2006  us airways reported cash and investments of approximately  3 billion         in addition  us airways has offered to pay  10 2 billion   including  5 billion of cash   to buy the much larger delta air lines  further demonstrating us airways  ability to bear the cost of its terminated pension plans   indeed  it is striking that the  5 billion in cash being offered as part of the hostile delta offer exceeds the full amount of the unfunded liabilities recently transferred to the pbgc   certainly  neither the pbgc  other employers paying premiums to the pbgc  innocent pensioners  nor taxpayers should bear billions in costs to enable companies to buy out their competitors         if us airways now clearly has ability to generate considerable cash and has easy access to credit markets  the company  s ability to restore its terminated pension plans must be fully explored   this is especially true in light of the fact that pbgc regulations would permit the restored plans to be funded over a period of up to 30 years  which is an even longer funding period than airlines are afforded under the pension protection

transportation and amtrak  to negotiate the restructuring of amtrak s debt within one year  if a restructuring results in significant savings  the secretary of treasury assumes the restructured debt  with the full faith and credit backing of the treasury        if no restructuring is possible  amtrak must pay the debt  such debt is solely the responsibility of amtrak  without any implied federal

following remarks from the senate floor today during consideration of legislation to expand embryonic stem cell research          mr  president  this is one of those debates that make the american people scratch their head  and ask    what are those people in washington thinking          from the perspective of everyday people  this should not even be a debate     of course we should fully fund research with embryonic stem cells    because it has the potential to save the lives and alleviate the suffering of millions of americans   that  s just common sense  but we have a president who is a captive of ideologues and extremists in his political party        nearly five years ago  president bush enacted a policy that made no scientific contribution  only political fodder for his reelection     he put a stop to development of new stem cell lines for research       that was a devastating blow to americans suffering from diabetes  cancer  parkinson  s  alzheimer  s  multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injuries  mr  president  for many years  i have met with children stricken with juvenile diabetes in my office  these children and their parents  brothers  and sisters ask me why the president is not allowing research to move forward that can cure their disease       there is no decent answer i can give them  when i asked them    what the worst thing about living with diabetes is           they respond plaintively  begging for help so they can stop drawing blood from their fingers    six times a day   they are pleading to live life like other kids   one child said he is forbidden to sleep over his friends   houses because of fright that he will go into insulin shock       i promised these kids i would do everything i can to get the message to the president  so we can get a cure for them   and now  today  we have the opportunity to finally help these kids       it has been over a year since the house passed this bill   why the delay   there is no comprehensible reason   we can only wonder how many people had their hopes dashed and their spirits broken during that wasted year  mr  president  americans in large majorities support stem cell research    so i can  t understand our fiddling while rome burns        72 percent of americans favor embryonic stem cells research  while just 24 percent oppose it    a three to one margin  one of the most outspoken supporters of stem cell research is former first lady nancy reagan  who spent ten years watching her husband suffer from alzheimer  s disease       virtually every major medical  scientific  and patients   rights group supports embryonic stem cell research        in my home state of new jersey  support for stem cell research is overwhelming   we were the second state after california to authorize embryonic stem cell research   but unfortunately  president bush has cut off federal funding for those projects        senator menendez and i recently visited the coriell institute in camden  new jersey  which was founded in 1953   it holds the world s largest collection of human cells for research  coriell has everything in place to find cures and help millions of people   but there is one problem   president bush is undermining their efforts with his irrational policy on stem cell research         because of the scarcity of embryonic stem cell lines caused by president bush  s executive order  the coriell institute in new jersey had to go overseas    to the technion institute in israel  to get access to an embryonic stem cell line   he denies hope to millions of people based on his standards of   ethics and morality      but what is ethical about denying a cure to children suffering from diabetes         what is moral about denying paralyzed people the chance to walk again  mr  president  any real ethical issues are addressed by this bill   new stem cell lines will come from embryos donated by fertility patients under strict guidelines  there will not be embryos created for research  what we are talking about in this bill are embryos that would otherwise be disposed of    thrown away       i believe compassion and common sense must prevail over rigid ideology  if we pass this bill  i understand that the president intends to veto it   that would be a terrible and tragic mistake       president bush has never vetoed a bill  in the nearly six years of his presidency   not one veto  what would it say to the american people if his first veto was of a bill that could save millions of lives       and i say to the american people  don  t be fooled by the sleight of hand we are seeing today   there are three bills being considered but only one of them matters   the other two bills are part of a shell game   they are there to give president bush something to sign  but will those two bills do much to help the american with a shaky hand from being cured of parkinson  s disease       will those two bills make real strides toward relieving a child with diabetes from the constant shots of insulin  i don  t think so       only one bill can do that    the house stem cell bill    lets vote to approve it',\n",

 i thank you for making sure new jersey is heardin this room and on our airwaves     let me be clear about why this hearing is so important  when you pick up your remote and turn to channel 9  you are not getting sufficient information about new jerseys neighborhoods  roads or schools     routinely  the news is about new york     new jersey news is largely forgotten or buried deep into newscasts  and thats wrong     channel 9 is licensed as a new jersey station     channel 9 has an obligation to cover the news that affects our communities  our businesses  and our families     in fact  the wwor license was specifically moved from new york city to new jersey for that very reason     the fccs 1983 decision moving the station to new jersey says  this station will not be a new jersey station in name only  it will serve the people of new jersey     regrettably  the station has failed to meet that obligation     leading up to the 2005 election for example  new jersey had several important electoral races     our residents deserved local coverage of those races to help them make informed decisions at the polls     but  remarkably  new york tv stations provided more coverage of new jersey races than channel 9  according to a rutgers study     and when you look at channel 9s web site  it markets itself as a new york station     its web site is my 9 new yorkand its web address is my9ny com     several years ago  wwor closed its trenton news bureau     what kind of coverage can we have for new jersey families without a news team in our state capital     and three years ago  channel 9 tried to move its news team out of our state completely     that was inexcusable  how can wwor do its job covering our state if its not even in new jersey     so i met with lachlan murdoch  then in charge of fox television stations  and whose father rupert murdoch owns news corporation  he agreed with us to keep the news operation in new jersey  where it remains today     that was one victory  but that is no substitute for true local coverage     new jersey is the only state in the country without its own media market  if we had our own market  it would be the fourth largest in the country     instead  we are wedged between new york city and philadelphia     this makes it hard enough for our residents to get the news about our schools  our safety and our communities     we expected channel 9 to help us overcome this problem  thats why it was licensed in new jersey in the first place     instead  they have forced new jerseys residents to tune to out of state stations     thats simply unacceptable for the 11th largest state in the country     if the fcc renews channel 9s license  it needs to get tough and make certain that new jersey gets the news coverage it needs and deserves     the fcc must require channel 9 to meet specific  measurable goals for its new jersey coverage     wwor must identify itself as a new jersey station     it must devote a specific and substantial amount of air time each week to new jersey news stories and events     it must document its new jersey coverage in a separate fcc report  the report should show date  time of day  duration and content in detail     and it must keep its news department and production studios in new jersey     when the fcc moved channel 9 from new york to new jersey  it said  at renewal time  it will be judged by how it has met the obligation to serve the needs of northern new jersey     its now renewal time  and the facts are clear  channel 9 has failed our state     channel 9 is based in new jersey  its time for the fcc to make sure it covers new jersey',\n",

legislation authored by sen  frank r  lautenberg  d nj  and sen  arlen specter  r pa  to provide justice for victims of state sponsored terrorism by giving them their day in court and helping them pursue the assets of countries that support terrorism  the legislation was included in the final conference version of the fy 2008 department of defense authorization bill  it will now go to the senate for approval and then to president bush for his signature   far too many americans have suffered at the hands of terrorism  my bill would allow victims of state sponsored terror to have their day in court  it would let victims sue countries and hold those countries accountable  said sen  lautenberg     i am pleased to cosponsor this legislation which gives the victims of terrorism and their families the ability to seek legal redress  said sen  specter  this bill reaffirms that the united states will not tolerate state sponsored terrorism   the legislation would amend the foreign services immunities act by allowing victims of state sponsored terror to sue countries that support and promote terrorism  the measure also would allow these victims to seize hidden commercial assets for compensation if they win judgments in court    this legislation is important to the families of the victims of the 1983 marine barracks bombing in beirut  lebanon  it will hold the government of iran accountable for the murder of 241 men in this bombing  one of whom was my brother  captain vincent l  smith  united states marine corps   the injustice of this over the long years has been a heavy burden    the iranian government has literally been getting away with murder for almost 24 years  the passage of this bill will bring justice by holding the criminals accountable for their crime  and i believe it will mitigate future terrorism  this bill is a huge statement of support for victims of terrorism  and a powerful way to fight terrorism without the use of military force  said lynn derbyshire  who serves as the national spokesperson for the beirut families   the legislation also was introduced as a bill    the justice for victims of state sponsored terrorism act  s 1944   and is based on a 1996 amendment to the foreign sovereign immunities act known as the flatow amendment  which enabled american victims of terrorism to pursue state sponsors of terrorism in court the billwould     reaffirm the rights of plaintiffs to sue state sponsors of terrorism       allow the seizure of hidden commercial assets belonging to terrorist states so victims of terrorism can be justly compensated      limit the number of appeals that a terrorist state can pursue in u s  courts      provide foreign nationals working for the u s  government these same benefits if they are victimized in a terrorist attack during their official duties  and     limit the number of appeals that the terror state can pursue in u s  courts       u s  district court ruled in september that iran owed the families of the 1983 bombing of the beirut marine barracks  which killed 241 servicemen   2 656 billion in damages for this attack  this legislation will enable these victims of

away from areas with a high concentration of people living with the disease  democrats and republicans in congress have joined together and offered emergency legislation in both chambers to temporarily reauthorize the ryan white act and increase the funding level so negotiations can continue          last week  the house energy and commerce committee passed a revised version of the ryan white act with a new formula that would steer resources away from states like new jersey and new york that have very high numbers of people living with hiv aids  while giving more funds to states with relatively low numbers of hiv aids cases          since its enactment  the ryan white act funds have helped millions of hiv aids patients receive the care and treatment services they need to live healthy and productive lives   unfortunately  under the bill sent to the full senate for a vote  many places that have a high number of hiv aids cases and substantial need for funding  including ny  nj  fl  il and ca  would lose millions of dollars   such an outcome would effectively dismantle entire systems of care and place patients at risk             changing the formula so more federal funding goes to states with relatively low numbers of people infected with hiv aids  while taking it away from states with high numbers of cases will put the lives of literally thousands of people at serious risk     said lautenberg    this is absolutely unconscionable               it is beyond belief that the federal government would shift funds from states with the highest incidence of hiv aids  to states with much lower levels     menendez said    this action is not only short sighted  but will place an extraordinary burden on states like new jersey who serve large populations of hiv aids patients  our measure aims to minimize the potentially disastrous effects of ill advised hiv aids policies    policies that hamper our nation  s overall war on hiv aids                              we are committed to making sure that those living with hiv and aids get the treatment they need    that must be the bottom line   we must ensure that the new york region  the epicenter of the aids epidemic  continues to have adequate funding while also recognizing the growing needs in states across the country   this is the right and fair approach   said senator clinton             the current version of the reauthorization defies every iota of reason  why should states like new york  which have the highest percentage of aids and hiv patients in the country  be stripped of its funding that goes to crucial treatment and prevention programs     schumer asked    plain and simple  this reauthorization punishes us for effectively utilizing money allocated by the original care act  we  ve reduced the number of hiv patients who eventually develop aids but we still have many patients to treat              new jersey has been at the forefront of treating hiv aids for years  but this unfair funding formula would penalize it and several other states for keeping patients alive and well   said pallone    the alternative legislation we introduced today will prevent this funding formula from becoming law  and will give us an additional year to negotiate a better formula           lautenberg  menendez and pallone noted that new jersey ranks fifth in the nation in the total number of aids cases and number one in the percentage of people with hiv or aids who are women          the ryan white comprehensive aids resources emergency  care  act is the federal law that addresses the unmet health needs of persons living with hiv disease by funding primary health care and support services that enhance access to care  first enacted by congress in 1990  it was amended

health of our state          our coasts are being developed at a frightening pace   said saxton  a senior member of the house natural resources committee who first introduced the bill in 2005  and

 sen  lautenberg and i will work to move this through both bodies of congress and have it signed into law        the legislation provides funds for land acquisition projects that are selected based on the priorities in a state s coastal zone management plan  coastal and estuarine land preservation projects that are identified in a management plan  like that for the barnegat bay national estuary program  are also eligible       the bill would authorize the national oceanic and atmospheric administration  noaa  to use federal funds to assist land acquisition in fiscal years 2008 through 2012

raised the separate issue of possible contract fraud  specifically  the gao revealed that the department of education could not produce evidence that mr  williams completed 167  activities  he claimed to have performed under the contract  the gao  conducting its own search on the internet  was also unable to locate evidence that these  activities  were performed  three days after these issues were exposed in the gao report  an article in monday s edition of usa today revealed that mr  williams is now seeking to repay some of the  186 000 he received under the contract  because he didn t promote the law or ask others to do so  as the contract required         over the past few days  information has come to light that raises questions about possible criminal violations surrounding the

you didn t do is fraud    period   said senator lautenberg   americans are already upset that the bush administration paid off a columnist to write glowing reviews of the president s education agenda  the notion that he may not have even done the work only makes it worse  did the administration knowingly enter into a  no show  contract          the propaganda contract with armstrong williams is not only a sign of the culture of corruption within the white house  but also reveals the carelessness that the administration took with funds intended to educate america s students  the money given to williams to spread propaganda should be returned to the treasury immediately  as that amount could allow 58 more students get the extra help they need under no child left behind  fraud and propaganda should have no place in our democracy    the american people deserve better   said senator kennedy       a copy of the letter citing the laws that may have been violated is attached to this release

accountability office  gao  ruled that the department of education illegally used taxpayer dollars to conduct covert propaganda activities  in part through a contract entered into with journalist armstrong williams to promote the president s education programs  in light of the gao s findings we have urged the secretary of education to seek recovery of the misspent funds        over the past few days  information has come to light that raises questions about possible criminal violations surrounding the department of education s contractual relationship with mr  armstrong williams  we strongly urge you to open an immediate investigation       the department of education first entered into a contractual relationship with mr  armstrong williams through his company  the graham williams group  gwg  in 2003  information gathered by the department of education inspector general  ig  and the gao  released in a gao legal decision on friday  suggest that gwg claimed to have performed activities under the contract that were not actually performed  in addition  mr  williams has made statements to the press this week admitting that the work was not performed as reported       in april  the department of education ig found that gwg claimed in its reports that mr  williams engaged in  168 activities  promoting the no child left behind program over the course of the year the contract covered  however  the gao  during its investigation saw only one column evidencing such activities  and the department of education was unable to provide any documentation that any of the other activities mr  armstrong cited were ever performed  the gao attempted to locate evidence of the other 167  activities  on the internet  but only found a handful of random columns and no other documents during the relevant period        the contract in question was entered into  performed and paid in 2003 and 2004  after the release of last week s gao report  usa today reported on monday that mr  williams is  discussing returning some of his fees because he didn t promote the law or ask others to do so  as the contract required   it is unclear under what procedure mr  williams is attempting to return the funds at this time       these developments warrant scrutiny under two statutes  18 u s c       1001 and 18 u s c       287  we believe it is critical to commence an investigation as soon as possible  as mr  williams is claiming that he is currently in discussions with the department of education about disposition of the funds his company received under the

the u s  air force and new jersey air guard on the forest fires that destroyed nearly 20 000 acres of the pine barrens in may    this investigation proved that failures by the pilot and the guard led to these forest fires  said sen  lautenberg  the guard must work to ensure there will be no more accidents  i will work with the community and the governor to ensure that the guard becomes a better neighbor and improves safety at the range   its clear that there were errors at multiple levels in the chain of command  and thats highly concerning for the safety of new jersey residents  this type of systematic failure  which led to homes destroyed and lives uprooted  is unacceptable  and we need to see a set of strong recommendations that will guarantee that the lives  safety and property of the citizens come first  said sen  menendez   we know the training mission at warren grove is crucial to the existence of the new jersey national s guard s f 16 fighter wing in atlantic city  saxton said  the facilities are also used by mcguire afb  fort dix and fort monmouth and are an important national asset to the national guard for developing the skills critical to survival in combat  what we want to see  however  is real improvements to safety for the surrounding communities  this wildfire should have never happened  and we want to see steps in place to prevent it from happening again  our pine barrens are one of new jersey s greatest natural resources  and any threat to it or the people who live there must be minimized   this fire was certainly preventable and my sympathies go out to those still recovering from this accident  i applaud the air force for their quick response and assistance to those affected  i also applaud the 177th fighter wing  which maintains operational control of the range  for quickly implementing safety precautions to prevent a future incident  said congressman lobiondo  there is no comparable range on the east coast to warren grove  which serves as a critical training tool for not only the 177th   the nation s premier homeland security unit   but also the training needs to other air force  army  marine  and national guard units  any plans to close the range would precipitate the closure of the 177th fighter wing in atlantic county  which would be detrimental to the region s and the nation s security   the accident investigation board  aib  report was prepared by the u s  air force and concluded that there were pervasive and systemic failures leading to the accident    from the initial information communicated by the on the ground flight control officer to the communications between the two pilots to the decision to drop the flare  the conclusion to the statement of opinion in report as expressed by the president of accident investigation board  air force major general emmett titshaw  is summarized as follows   there is clear and convincing evidence that the cause of the fires that started at warren grove gunnery range on may 15 was wingman pilot error  the wingman pilot deployed a flare or flares that impacted the range and ignited a fire  which spread beyond the warren grove range boundaries  the pilot deployed these flares below the warren grove range restricted altitude for flare use of 500 feet above ground level  substantially contributing to this mishap were the failure of the lead pilot to communicate with the wingman pilot concerning his intended use of flares and to properly coordinate the wingmans intent to use flares during the flight on the range coordination sheet  the range control officers failure to convey additional restrictions on flare use at the warren grove range  the wingman pilots lack of information concerning additional restrictions on flare use at the warren grove range  and the unplanned show of force maneuver flown by the wingman pilot and requested by the warren grove range control officer   the fire burned more than 17 000 acres and displaced thousands of residents in the pine barrens when a flare was dropped by a new jersey air guard f 16 jet on a training mission    in may  sens  lautenberg and menendez met with general sid clarke  deputy director of the air national guard  and adjutant general glen rieth  commander of the new jersey national guard  to discuss the fire and plans to improve safety and operations at the range  reps  saxton and lobiondo have also spoken with gen  reith and col  randall king  commander of 177th fighter wing out of atlantic county    the fire in may was the latest in a string of incidents near the warren grove range     in april 1999  a pennsylvania national guard a 10 jet aiming for the range instead dropped a dummy bomb a mile off target over the pinelands in burlington county  touching off a fire that burned 12 000

plants from terrorist attacks  following a weak proposal offered last week by the bush administration that would continue to leave millions of americans at serious risk  united states senators frank r  lautenberg  d nj  and barack obama  d il  authored the chemical security and safety act  which is cosponsored by senators john f  kerry  d ma   robert menendez  d nj   richard j  durbin  d il  and joe biden  d de        the lautenberg obama bill goes farther to protect communities than any other proposal by requiring companies to use safer chemicals whenever possible  a practice known as inherently safe technology  ist   the measure will also require larger perimeter barriers around chemical plants  protect the rights of states to enact tougher chemical security standards  establish whistleblower protections for employees who expose security risks at chemical facilities  and guarantee that workers have a role in securing the safety of facilities       the bush administration s proposal outlined last week by homeland security secretary michael chertoff  calls for state laws to be nullified and rejects the use of inherently safe technology        in a nutshell  the bush administration s approach is  trust the chemical industry    they ll do the right thing   it didn t work with enron and it won t work here   said senator lautenberg   an attack on chemical plants would threaten millions of americans and president bush responds to the threat with a hollow proposal  this incompetence by the bush administration cannot be allowed to continue         there may be no greater failure of our government than the fact that we have done almost nothing to secure one of america s most vulnerable targets   the 15 000 chemical plants in america   said obama   these chemical plants represent some of the most attractive targets for terrorists looking to cause widespread death and destruction  unfortunately  at many of the chemical plants in our nation  the security is light  the facilities are easily entered  and the contents are deadly         the administration s plan to outsource our ports was the tip of the iceberg   said senator kerry   there are chemical plants in cities and towns all across america but the bush white house has consistently bowed to pressure from industry  backing away from and even aggressively blocking regulations to beef up security  that s a disgrace  surely we can put these common sense measures in place to keep our families and our communities safe          we cannot afford to wait another day to strengthen security at the chemical plants that dot our state  these plants pose a risk to millions of new jerseyans  and it is long past time for the federal government to implement strict measures to make them safer   said senator menendez         chemical plant security is a serious problem and the combination of lax security and deadly chemicals is a toxic mix   said durbin   illinois has more facilities that store extremely hazardous materials then any other state  with over 100 000 pounds of hazardous substances stored in over 600 facilities  we need a new direction for security in this country  one that includes creating tough  enforceable standards for chemical plant security          chemical plants are a top target for terrorists  many of the nation s largest chemical facilities are located in places where a toxic release could injure or kill tens of thousands of people   said biden   the department of homeland security should not abdicate responsibility for chemical plant security to the chemical industry  we should set national standards for securing chemical plants and take immediate steps to safeguard the most vulnerable facilities        there are about 15 000 chemical manufacturers and storage facilities nationwide by one count  including about 110 in heavily populated areas        the greatest  zone of vulnerability  in the u s  is in south kearney  nj  where 12 million people live in proximity to the kuehne chemical plant  an explosion at the facility would endanger the life and health of people caught in the path of the prevailing winds  chemical security presents one of the biggest domestic threats in the u s  richard falkenrath  a former top presidential advisor on homeland security  has said   i am aware of no other category of potential terrorist targets that presents as great a danger         a fact sheet on the lautenberg obama chemical security and safety act is attached to this release       lautenberg obama the chemical security and safety act      the lautenberg obama bill does the following       requires the use of safer chemicals when possible  which is commonly referred to as  inherently safe technology  or ist       protects state authority to adopt stronger protections than federal law        improves site security to the maximum extent possible        guarantees that workers have a role ensuring the security and safety of facilities        provides strong protection for whistleblowers        ensures a role for epa administrator  and agency expertise  in oversight of chemical facilities       protects

nj  yesterday help steer passage of the pipeline inspection  protection  enforcement and safety  pipes  act of 2006   h r  5782   a bill that will require excess flow valves to be installed on all new or replacement pipes in single family homes   these inexpensive safety valves can automatically shut off a ruptured line  which helps prevent injury  protect property and save lives         a gas leak in a home can be a silent killer   with the strong safety provisions we  ve enacted today  like requiring new or replacement homes to have emergency valves  we can help people feel more comfortable that the pipes leading into their homes are safe     lautenberg said        lautenberg is a leader on surface transportation issues in the senate  s commerce  science and transportation committee  which has jurisdiction over pipeline safety   the committee is co chaired by senators daniel inouye  d hi  and ted stevens  r ak    lautenberg first introduced legislation to strengthen federal oversight of pipelines in 1995      the bill also authorizes more federal pipeline safety inspectors  50 percent over the 4 years life of the bill  to inspect country  s 2 3 million miles of natural gas  oil  and hazardous liquid pipelines  and creates new regulations for the nation  s low stress oil transmission pipelines  including those in prudhoe bay  alaska   this summer  the nation faced a major oil shortage when the prudhoe bay line was partially shut down due to severe corrosion  and poor maintenance and inspection   prudhoe bay produces 400 000 barrels of oil a day      senator lautenberg has worked to improve pipeline safety and security since 1994  when a gas pipeline exploded in edison  new jersey   the resulting explosion and fire burned eight apartment buildings to the ground  left 128 families homeless and sent 1 500 people running for safety   federal investigations found the use of automatic safety valves would have prevented much of the damage        a summary of the pipes act is attached to this release      summary of pipeline inspection  protection  enforcement  and safety act of 2006  pipes act      the bill reauthorizes federal pipeline safety programs  which are administered by the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration  phmsa   for fiscal years 2007 through 2010   highlights of the bill include      increased federal resources dedicated to overseeing pipeline safety the bill provides  6 million for an additional 45 federal inspectors  a 50  increase  during its four year authorization period   currently phmsa has 90 inspectors  but the dot inspector general has stated that this relatively low staffing level is a matter for concern   this current staffing level translates to one federal inspector for every 18 000 miles of pipeline nationwide   this funding increase  along with the bulk of the bill  is paid for with user fees and will not raise the deficit      strengthened programs to reduce construction related damage to pipelines the bill includes new civil enforcement authority against excavators and pipeline operators responsible for third party damage incidents and provides grants to states that have damage prevention programs   construction related damage  such as damage caused by excavation for a highway project  is the greatest cause of pipeline accidents that result in death or injury  with the number of third party damage incidents up dramatically over the past several years   damage from such incidents often impacts the local natural gas pipeline distribution systems that run through the neighborhoods where people live and work      mandates use of excess flow valves in new single family residences the bill mandates that all new single family residences or replaced service lines in single family residences have an excess flow valve installed   this safety device automatically shuts off the flow of gas when a rupture occurs   the national transportation safety board recommends their use where feasible      applying dot safety standards to the currently unregulated low stress pipelines the bill requires dot oversight and regulation of the nation  s low stress transmission pipelines  including those in prudhoe bay  alaska involved in accidents this year   in august  the dot announced a proposed rule to cover low stress pipelines in unusually sensitive areas   the bill and the proposed rule alike would require pipeline operators to meet new safety regulations  including cleaning and continuous monitoring   however  the dot proposal would cover about only

lautenberg  mr  president  i am sure that what is taking place on the floor of the senate must present a terribly confusing picture to the american people  it is hard to understand even being here  with colleagues shouting their support for the american troops while they inject that what they need is an injection of truth serum for the vote  then it will be plain and simple to see where they are  those who are opposing a direct vote  an up or down  as we call it  to take place  and that will answer the question  do you want our soldiers  airmen  seamen  and marines returned home  as the american people are demanding  i remind our friends that the obligation is to get our people back to their families as soon as possible     outside my office  i pay respect to america s lost soldiers  our casualties of war  in a display called the   faces of the fallen    it gives a picture and some background of the soldiers who gave their lives in this ill conceived and seemingly endless war in iraq  every day  families  friends  and visitors search through thousands of photos looking to see if there are people they know  while they try to comprehend the human cost of this war to parents  spouses  children  siblings  and friends across our country    four years and four months have passed since president bush sent young american men and women to fight in a war based on faulty intelligence and incomplete information about an enemy and the scope of this ferocious conflict  now 160 000 american men and women are mired in a civil war in iraq  facing thousands of insurgents willing to die themselves while they try to kill any american they can find   mr  president  3 613 brave american souls will never again sit at a family table  play with their children  or return to their jobs and their communities  ninety one of those men and women came from new jersey  they set their boots on the ground in iraq never expecting they would not put them back on american soil again  now their faces and their stories live on only in our memories     but the solemn story those numbers tell does not stop there  nearly 27 000 troops have left combat with wounds to their body  more than 800 of them have lost limbs or sight or other senses  many more have left with their minds totally impaired  more than 30 000 soldiers now live with post traumatic stress disorder or brain injuries  robbing them of the ability to think clearly or perform tasks that once came easily  they put themselves in the line of fire and fought to give the president s policy a chance  but the policy has failed    it was more than three years ago that the president  in military dress  staged on the deck of the aircraft carrier uss abraham lincoln  proudly declared   mission accomplished    mission accomplished  a declaration of victory in millions of american minds  how casual  how cruel  how inept  the president did this without hesitation or pause or the idea of the cost soldiers would come to endure in the future and the hellfire they would face  there were 139 american soldiers who had died by that date  by the day that   mission accomplished   was declared  compare that with today s count  which stands above 3 600  mr  president  139 american soldiers then    mission accomplished    and now the death toll is over 3 600    mission accomplished    a show of grandeur  a curtain of disaster  misleading  and i don t know if the president really understood what was taking place in front of his eyes   today  the president continues to use statements that defy reality  vice president cheney joined in  he said in those times    we will be greeted as liberators with sweets and treats    with not a hint of intelligence available before that  today  the president continues to use statements that defy reality  we have to look back a little bit to see when secretary of defense rumsfeld said this war could last six days  six weeks  perhaps  i doubt  six months  he said that in february of 2003  a month before the invasion  what were they thinking  it is hard to understand  they were getting intelligence  they had the best information available  and they didn t use it     just last week  the president said    the same folks that are bombing innocent people in iraq were the ones who attacked us in america on september 11th  this statement smacks of the same careless rhetoric we heard four years ago  the most frightening part about that statement is either president bush actually believes what he is saying  doesn t bother to check  or is he deliberately distracting the american people   the fact is that osama bin laden and al qaida attacked us on 9 11 and iraq had nothing to do with the tragedy of 9 11  the defense department s own inspector general confirmed this past february that the saddam hussein regime was not directly cooperating with al qaida before the u s  invasion of iraq  has the president forgotten about osama bin laden  the man responsible for inflicting those wounds on the victims  their families  and this country  the war with al qaida and the hunt for osama bin laden began and continues outside of iraq  yet osama bin laden is still at large  and al qaida has become stronger as a result of president bush s failed policies     this administration took its eye off the ball  instead of capturing or killing osama bin laden  we are stuck in the middle of a civil war in iraq with ever escalating american casualties  that is why some of us in this congress believe deep in our minds and in our souls that this carnage must end and we have to fight to bring our troops home from iraq    we are fighting with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle who are giving us reasons to continue with the surge and continue with the exposure in harm s way of our brave men and women   millions of americans are begging us for a change of course  they are tired of having their sons and daughters coming home in flag covered coffins  coffins that are hidden from the public eye by order of the pentagon  they don t even let pictures be taken of those flag draped coffins showing the honor that is bestowed upon the person in that coffin     the american people want congress to step in and start to bring our troops home in a responsible way  the amendment by senators levin and reed would do just that  it would begin to redeploy our troops out of iraq within 120 days and remove all combat troops by the end of april of next year  some american forces would remain to perform counterterrorism operations  protect u s  personnel  and to train iraqi forces    this amendment reflects the will of the american people  and it is a responsible way to phase our troops out of the civil war in iraq  but instead of having a vote to decide where a majority of the congress stands  our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are standing in the way  they are resorting to process to keep us from having a vote so that the american people can see very clearly where we each stand on this issue  so we stayed here all night  that is not much of a sacrifice  that is not much when you consider our people in iraq and afghanistan   soon  every senator will go on record  and their constituents will know whether they want to continue the president s failed policy or are they looking for a new  brighter day  a chance to bring our people back to their families     some of our colleagues on the other side have called for change  if you look at recent votes  seven of them had the courage to stand with the democrats and say  yes  we agree that this conflict has gone on long enough and we ought to start doing something to bring them home  but with the president dug in on staying the course  saying the right thing is not enough  change will only come with a vote    so i ask my colleagues to stand up and support the levin reed amendment so we can begin to bring our men and women home  let the american people hear our sincerity  and they will when they see procedural attempts to hide this vote and obstruct the return    the slogan they are using is   cut and run    the result would be   stay and die       i yield the floor and the remainder of my time',\n",

estimated 59 percent  many experts believe the requirements to annually disclose the levels of released toxins into the environment were the main factor in this dramatic reduction       in september of last year  the epa notified congress of its intent reduce the frequency of toxics reporting from every year to every two years  at the same time  epa initiated two additional changes that will allow thousands of facilities to withhold details about pollution volumes  waste management and treatment if they generate less than 5 000 pounds of toxic chemicals per year        the tri program was established on the principle that the public has a right to know about chemicals that are being stored and released in their communities  the agency s proposal would curtail that right  leaving

rep  frank pallone  d nj  today issued a letter to the environmental protection agency  epa  and the us army corps of engineers  the federal agencies responsible for protecting the new jersey coastline  to determine what went wrong this past labor day weekend when trash and other debris washed ashore in ocean county and forced several beaches to close   several beaches along the jersey shore were closed during part of the busy holiday weekend because of the trash that washed ashore the source of the waste    which beachgoers said included syringes  tampon applicators and gauze    was not immediately known   too many labor day holidays were cut short when garbage washed ashore and forced authorities to close our beaches  said sen  lautenberg beachgoers are supposed to be protected from these slicks by a coordinated effort of surveillance and response from state and federal agencies  we need to know what went wrong so we can keep our beaches open and prevent this from happening again   the thousands of vacationers who were disappointed by closed beaches over the holiday weekend know firsthand that the plan to keep the shore clean must be solidified  said sen  menendez  its priority for our states environment  for our states economy and for all of us who love the jersey shore   since 1989  we have worked to improve beach quality along the jersey shore with the floatables action plan  rep  pallone said along the way  epa made changes to address problems that arose after the garbage wash up in ocean county over the labor day weekend  it s clear that epa needs to once again investigate what went wrong so that we can continue to strengthen this program to protect beachgoers in the future   it is like any plumbing system when it works  you take it for granted  but when it breaks  watch out the nj ny estuary floatable action plan is a national model  when it works the failures that caused this slick to escape into the ocean must be determined and corrected not only does this garbage pollute beaches  it is harmful to marine life we applaud the leadership and action of us senator lautenberg  us senator menendez and us representative pallone to track down the cracks in the program  so they can be fixed  said cindy zipf  executive director of clean ocean action   the floatables action plan was developed in 1989 in response to the massive garbage slicks and beach closures that took place the previous two summers numerous agencies coordinate efforts to carry out this plan  which works to prevent garbage from washing ashore by conducting aerial surveillance for slicks in the new york new jersey harbor these agencies are charged with cleaning up slicks as quickly as possible    the agencies  including the epa  are responsible for conducting aerial surveillance to search for floating debris  if and when debris is located  these agencies are supposed to notify the us army corps of engineers  which then sends skimmer vessels to the area for clean up         the following is the letter sen  lautenberg  sen  menendez and rep  pallone issued to the epa and us army corps of engineers     the honorable alan steinberg administrator  region 2 u s  environmental protection agency  1200 pennsylvania ave   n w  washington  d c  20460  colonel aniello l  tortora  new york district  united states corps of engineers  26 federal plaza  new york  new york 10278  dear regional administrator steinberg and colonel tortora   we are writing in response to the recent reports of large amounts of garbage and debris washing up on the beaches of new jersey we are greatly disturbed that the ny nj harbor estuary floatables action plan did not identify and prevent the heavy wash up of garbage that led to beach closures over the holiday weekend the debris has caused beach closings in normandy beach  nj  and many other municipalities reported greater than usual amounts of trash on their beaches in addition  during the week of august 20th  a forewarning wash up occurred along the northern bayshore region and caused beach closures in middletown  nj    as you know  in 1989 the army corps of engineers  acoe  and the environmental protection agency  epa  region 2 designed the floatables action plan to identify and remove garbage slicks from the new york new jersey harbor  to prevent beach closures and adverse impacts on coastal species and commercial and recreational boating to date  the plan has been successful in reducing garbage in the harbor and subsequently diminished the number of beach closures resulting from debris waste   however the recent beach closures raise serious questions about the floatables action plan please provide information on whether there was a breakdown in the plan that led to this debris wash up  in addition  please identify any suggested changes that may lead to the improvement of the plan and provide information on whether this plan is adequately funded    it is important to our constituents that we work together to address these problems our coastal environment has been steadily improving over the last 15 years  thanks to the collective efforts of many federal  state and local agencies we must continue to work together so that we do not go back to the time when debris and trash plagued our waterways and beaches    thank you for your attention to this matter  we look forward to continuing to work together',\n",

that transport  handle  and store especially hazardous cargoes  ehcs   the transportation of ehcs by ship can pose a significant risk to the public safety and the economic security of the nation  particularly the transportation of chemicals and petrochemicals such as anhydrous ammonia  ammonium nitrate  chlorine  liquefied natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas  currently  no international standards exist for the safe and secure handling of these chemicals petrochemicals by ship and limited u s  coast guard resources for ehc security poses a dangerous risk to our communities       security risks of maritime transport of ehcs     identified by dhs   u s  department of homeland security officials have identified vulnerabilities of ehc facilities vessels to the public at large      inherent dangers of ehcs   studies have shown that under certain conditions there is potential for wide area fires and deadly heat waves reaching over a mile from the source      recently  2004   an

government accountability office  gao  to preserve funding for cities with high incidents of hiv and aids  under title i of the ryan white care act  signing a letter to the gao were senators frank r  lautenberg  d nj   hillary rodham clinton  d ny   charles schumer  d ny   dianne feinstein  d ca  and barbara boxer  d ca        the two biggest funding streams in the care act are titles i and ii  title i money is for cities with high rates of aids cases and title ii money is for states with the bulk of the money going to aids drug assistance programs  adaps   new jersey receives both money for cities and states because of the high incidence of aids in the state        at a hearing thursday in the homeland security and governmental affairs committees subcommittee on federal financial management  the gao presented preliminary findings on variations in funding between states that receive funding for individual cities  and those that only receive statewide grants  states that receive funding for cities under title i of the care act are in danger of losing those resources because of the perception they are  double dipping   but the gao failed to account for the scope of services provided  the cost of living in various areas  and the differences between community   driven services provided by cities and the state level services provided under title ii        changing such an allocation so that states receive funding only for cases located outside of emas would devastate the current aids service  and result in delays or denials of care for the vast majority of people living with aids   the senators wrote in their letter       senator lautenberg coauthored the ryan white aids care act and helped secure funding for the program  he also helped include jersey city as one of special targeted recipients of aid  along with the newark metro area        hiv continues to take a huge toll in our cities  and people will suffer if we reduce services   said lautenberg   we have to focus our resources where they are needed most   and that means the areas with the highest rates of hiv and aids       the text of the letter is available below        the honorable david m  walker comptroller general of the united states united states government accountability office  gao  441 g street  n w  washington  d c  20548      dear mr  walker       as senators representing states with high hiv aids caseloads and populations served by title i eligible metropolitan areas  emas   we are concerned with the preliminary data as presented in the testimony of the gao before the subcommittee on federal financial management  government information  and international security of the senate homeland security and government affairs committee on thursday  june 23  we would hope that in the final report  the gao will take into account the necessity for stable  continued funding for the title i ema program  which provides community directed services  care and treatment to the vast majority of those living with hiv aids in the united states       we would like the gao to address the following issues in its final report       the role of the grandfather clause in ensuring service provision  in the ryan white care act  a clause from the 1996 reauthorization states that emas designated prior to fiscal year 1996 will remain an eligible metropolitan area in subsequent fiscal years  even if the criteria for designation as an ema are not currently met by several grantees  over 70  of the americans living with aids reside in areas served by title i funding  clearly  the burden of the domestic epidemic is still disproportionately based in cities that receive title i funding  we would ask that  in the final report  the gao include a discussion of the barriers to care and treatment in emas that would arise were the grandfather clause to be lifted  we would also ask that you consider the role the grandfather clause has played in protecting areas with a high prevalence rate  as defined in the 1990 care act  these areas would have been severely impacted by the 1996 reauthorization s elimination of the density factor from the title i formula were it not for this grandfather clause        the inadequacies of using a per capita formula in funding analyses  there has been some concern that the amount allocated to various regions does not represent an equal distribution  on a per capita basis  of funding  what such an analysis fails to consider is both the level of services provided and the cost of living in various areas  per capita funding formulations do not address the scope of services provided and the true extent of need in high cost of living areas like new york city  san francisco  and other emas  in your report  we ask that the gao consider both the range and actual cost of services provided in states and local communities prior to any analysis of funding distributions       the continued need for separate title i and title ii funding streams  there is a perception that states with emas are somehow  double dipping  into ryan white care act funding  as such areas benefit from both title i and title ii funding streams  however  such criticism fails to take into account differences between the local  community driven services provided in emas  and the state level services funded by title ii  this issue has already been addressed legislatively in the care act  formula allocations in title ii specifically place a greater weight on cases in non ema areas  so that more funding will be directed to non ema states  changing such an allocation so that states receive funding only for cases located outside of emas would devastate the current aids service infrastructure  and result in delays or denials of care for the vast majority of people living with aids  we would ask that when examining title i vs  title ii funding issues  the gao take into account the impact of reducing title ii funding upon service provision in these states with the greatest burden of cases        thank you for your consideration of our request',\n",

the legislators expressed concern that residents from south jersey have been unable to sufficiently voice their opinions on the redesign proposal which could have a large impact on their quality of life  meetings have previously been held in north jersey  too far for many in the southern region of the state to attend  and in philadelphia  which was so heavily attended that several hundred people had to be turned away  to date  no meetings have been held in the southern part of the state      residents in south jersey who will be impacted by the redesign plan are especially concerned over increased noise from a higher level of air traffic and the impact on their quality of life and property value  on march 23  the senators wrote a letter to the faa expressing their concerns over the airspace redesign plans  specifically citing the impact it would have on gloucester county  http   menendez senate gov pdf faaairspaceredesign3 23 07 pdf   last year the senators joined with members of the new jersey house delegation in expressing their apprehensions about an faa proposal and its statewide effects  http   menendez senate gov newsroom record cfm id 257999                 full text of the letter appears below       the honorable marion blakey  administrator  federal aviation administration  800 independence ave   s w   washington  dc 20591         dear administrator blakey       we write regarding the public meetings the federal aviation administration  faa  recently held regarding its plans for new york new jersey philadelphia airspace redesign   these public meetings are designed to provide an opportunity for residents of communities affected by your agency s plan to learn details of the impact and have their questions answered   however  we think the meetings held thus far did not provide an adequate opportunity for those who will be affected by the faa plan to learn of the impact and voice their concerns       we learned with dismay that at the most recent meeting  which took place on may 1 in essington  pennsylvania  hundreds of area residents were not able to have their concerns heard   given the overwhelming response in attendance it is clear that many are concerned about the faa s plans   we believe the faa should take into account the severe impact this proposal would have on many residents across the state   as the faa has proposed  this airspace redesign plan could significantly alter the quality of life some 300 000 new jerseyans  exposing them to increased noise and lowering their property values   furthermore  the planned flight patterns would affect residents from very different parts of the state         we are particularly displeased that our previous requests for an additional meeting have gone ignored   before these meetings took place  we expressed our concerns to you that many new jersey residents  specifically those in gloucester county  would not have sufficient opportunity to participate in the public meeting process because of the insufficient effort faa was making to accommodate them          given the extenuating circumstances of the meeting in pennsylvania  we urge you to provide new jerseyans another opportunity to hear from the faa on these plans   for many new jersey residents in the southern part of our state  the pennsylvania meeting location was closer than the meeting held in newark  new jersey   because of the direct impact the redesign would have on communities in southern new jersey  we urge you find a location that is convenient for residents from this region         we thank you for your immediate consideration of this matter   new jerseyans should be given sufficient opportunity to learn about the impacts of the plan and provide their feedback   until this occurs  the redesign should not move forward',\n",

environmental protection agency  epa  to take immediate action to remove capacitors leaking cancer causing pcbs from the bound brook adjacent to the superfund site that housed cornell dubilier electronics in south plainfield         in addition  in their letter to epa administrator steve johnson sent today  the senators urged the agency to implement an aggressive program to warn residents of the dangers of consuming fish or other exposure to toxic contaminants from the site       sen  lautenberg  a member of the senate environment and public works committee  visited the superfund site in february to say the epa was proceeding too slowly in cleaning up the country s hazardous waste sites         new jersey has more superfund sites than any other state in the nation   the south plainfield site  which  according to the epa  is highly contaminated with pcbs  23 metals and 19 pesticides  was added in 1998        a copy of the letter is attached                dear administrator johnson       we are writing to request that the environmental protection agency  epa  take immediate action to address the human health and environmental threats from capacitor and asbestos disposal areas located in the vicinity of the bound brook  adjacent to the cornell dubilier electronics superfund site in south plainfield  new jersey   these capacitors were discovered by the edison wetlands association  ewa  during a recent stream inspection as part of their raritan river project         while we appreciate the immediate removal of some of the capacitors leaking into the bound brook  we believe epa needs to fully respond to this public health threat and address it in its entirety immediately   as you know  the cornell dubilier electronics superfund site is listed by your agency as a site where human exposure is not under control  ewa sampling revealed pcb levels up to 260 000 parts per million  as well as extremely high levels of asbestos  in a stream corridor draining directly through popular public fishing areas   the new jersey department of environmental protection residential cleanup criteria for pcbs is  49 parts per million   the pcb levels in the fish in the bound brook are some of the highest levels in the state of new jersey           epa s preliminary conceptual site model report of 2006  makes clear that your agency recognizes the serious health risks posed to local residents   this report states that children and adults are potentially being exposed to the floodplain soils of the bound brook through playing  landscaping  gardening and exercise   in addition  this report notes that residents may be consuming contaminated fish they catch and may be unaware of current fishing advisories  due to a lack of adequate warning signs       based on the extreme levels of contamination at this site and the potential for human exposure and serious damage to our natural resources  we urge the epa to immediately utilize the superfund emergency removal program to excavate and dispose of all the capacitors  remnants of capacitors  other similar items  and asbestos in the bound brook floodplain   the epa needs to physically inspect both sides of the bound brook  particularly on the banks  to address this hazardous waste and prevent further migration downstream        following this removal action  we urge epa to implement an expedited sampling program to locate any additional areas or material that may be contaminating the bound brook   a comprehensive investigation of the area must be implemented to define the extent of the pcb disposal area and to design its complete removal  these wastes represent a continuing source of pcb contamination to the bound brook  and actions in this portion of the cornell dubilier superfund site must be given top priority by the agency        finally  epa should implement an aggressive community notification program to inform residents along the bound brook of the dangers associated with consuming fish or coming into contact with site related contaminants   this should include the installation of numerous bilingual signs along the brook and holding public meetings in the municipalities potentially impacted by the pcb contamination in the bound brook  including south plainfield  piscataway  middlesex borough  bound brook and south bound brook       we appreciate the work that epa is currently conducting at this site  including the demolition of contaminated buildings   however  in addition to these buildings  it appears that these capacitors and contaminated sediments may pose a significant additional threat and we urge you to respond accordingly         thank you for your consideration of this critical matter   we look forward to your reply',\n",

protection agency  epa  to test the homes of families and expand the testing and monitoring of children who were exposed to mercury while attending the kiddie kollege day care in franklin township       the day care facility was closed down on july 28  2006 due to extremely high levels of mercury vapor   this day care center was apparently built on top of a now closed thermometer factory         the health and safety of new jersey  s children is priority number one  and the federal government must do all it can to ensure those children who may have been exposed get the best possible care     said senator lautenberg  who wrote letters to the director of the cdc as well the epa regional administrator       in his letter to the head of the cdc  lautenberg asked the agency to expand conditional testing and monitoring of all children and adults who were exposed to mercury  currently  the cdc will only continue to test those that have above 5 micrograms of mercury per gram of creatinine        parents have expressed serious concern that there may be mercury in their homes   therefore lautenberg urged the epa to immediately offer to test the homes of any parents who had children attending the kiddie kollege facility for mercury contamination       both letters are attached to this release       august 29  2006        regional administrator alan steinberg   us epa region ii  290 broadway  ny  ny  10007          dear administrator steinberg       i am writing to urge your agency  s immediate assistance regarding the kiddie college day care center in franklin township  new jersey         as you are aware  this day care facility was closed down on july 28  2006 due to extremely high levels of mercury vapor   this day care center was apparently built on top of a now closed thermometer factory and clearly should never have been allowed to open and operate   the nj dep  property owners  franklin township officials and others are attempting to determine how this situation occurred          early on  no one knew what was happening at kiddie college and parents saw little cause for alarm   then the parents of one child who attended the day care center discovered mercury on their daughter s backpack   as you know  mercury exposure and contamination is serious and can result in numerous and significant health effects   since this incident  these same parents expressed a concern that more mercury may be present in their home or in the homes of other families           sixty nine children and nine adults were then tested for mercury poisoning by the centers for disease control and about one third of them will require additional monitoring and testing due to mercury levels of concern   this situation is untenable for the parents who entrusted their childrens safety to kiddie college  they worry about the possible health effects  both short and long term  which mercury exposure could have on their small children         parents have expressed a very real concern that there may be more mercury in their home or in the homes of other parents due to direct contact with their children   as you know  mercury is difficult for everyday people to detect  and exposure and contamination is an extremely serious health risk which can result in numerous significant health effects          i am therefore writing to urge that your agency immediately offer to test the homes for mercury contamination  of any parents who had children attending the kiddie kollege facility   given the above information  it is entirely possible that children may have been bringing mercury into their homes and that it may still be present there   with everything these parents have had to endure recently  it is important to give them peace of mind that their family does not continue to be exposed to mercury in their own home         thank you for your review of this important matter   i would appreciate your immediate response

  dear dr  gerberding       i am writing to request important additional assistance from the agency for toxic substances and disease registry  atsdr  regarding the kiddie college day care center in franklin township  new jersey   specifically  i am urging you to continue testing and monitoring for all children and adults affected by this traumatic situation  not just those who originally tested above 5 micrograms of mercury per gram of creatinine         as you are aware  this day care facility was closed down on july 28  2006 due to extremely high levels of mercury vapor   this day care center was apparently built on top of a now closed thermometer factory and clearly should never have been allowed to open and operate           from the beginning  atsdr has been very responsive to the concerns of the community and of the parents   i understand that your agency has participated in two community briefings to educate the parents on the current situation of mercury exposure  the possible health effects on their children and to assist them with the urine testing process and explain the results         as you know  69 children and 9 adults were tested for mercury exposure by the centers for disease control   i understand that about 2 3 of those tested had levels below your cutoff of 5 micrograms of mercury per gram of creatinine and will not receive further testing by your agency          i have been contacted by concerned parents of a child who attended kiddie kollege and whose test results fall below the cutoff for additional testing   while they are certainly relieved that her levels are below your cutoff  they remain very concerned about the possible health effects that mercury exposure could have on their young child   they have requested assistance in obtaining additional testing for their child  to ensure that she does not face short or long term health effects         as you can imagine  this situation has been extremely traumatic for both the parents and children   given the circumstances  i would urge your agency to conduct additional testing and monitoring for the children and adults below the 5 micrograms level   these parents have certainly earned the right to feel that everything possible is being done to monitor the health of their children         thank you again for your agency  s actions to date   i would appreciate your

this task force report to congress and the public on the cause of these incidents and what changes in law and regulation are needed to prevent future problems      as you are aware  since early december  at least 169 people in new jersey  new york  delaware  south carolina and utah have been sickened  by e  coli 0157 h7  a deadly and aggressive strain of the bacteria   most of these people ate at restaurants affiliated with the same fast food chain   there is strong evidence that this outbreak can be traced to produce used in these restaurants        we urge your agencies to convene a multi agency task force and develop recommendations on how to effectively address the problem of foodborne illness associated with fresh produce   we would welcome your recommendations on what changes in law may need to be made by congress  and what steps can be taken at the agency level   we would strongly encourage the task force to take into consideration the views of appropriate interested parties  such as small farmers and other growers  food safety consumer groups  industry representatives  and state agencies            the latest outbreak is not the first time that fresh produce has been linked to a foodborne disease outbreak  in 2003  an outbreak of hepatitis a in pennsylvania  which killed 4 people and sickened 600  was traced to green onions from a chi chi  s restaurant   earlier this year  e  coli contaminated spinach killed at least 3 people and sickened over 200   while the fda has issued voluntary food safety guidance to the produce industry over the years  these recent outbreaks indicate that this voluntary approach may be insufficient to protect the public       according to usda  s economic research service  hazards in food cause an estimated 76 million illnesses  325 000 hospitalizations  and 5 000 deaths in the united states each year  this is most likely an underestimation as many occurrences of foodborne illness are never reported to public health officials   at greatest risk are older americans  children  pregnant women  and those with weakened immune systems   these latest incidents illustrate that we need to do more to reduce the risk of food borne illness in our country      thank you for your consideration of this request        sincerely     frank r  lautenberg richard durbin hillary clinton charles schumer robert

schumer  d ny  and hillary rodham clinton  d ny   today released their respective holds on the ryan white care act  following vigorous negotiations with both republican and democratic colleagues that will save new jersey and new york from millions in proposed cuts  the final version of the act reauthorization still includes a one time reduction in overall funding for new york and new jersey  but eliminates the tens of millions more in proposed cuts that would decimate the ability of new york and new jersey to serve people living with hiv and aids          the ryan white comprehensive aids resources emergency  care  act is the federal law that addresses the unmet health needs of persons living with hiv disease by funding primary health care and support services that enhance access to care          earlier versions of this year  s reauthorization threatened drastic cuts of over  100 million for both new jersey and new york   a prospect unacceptable to lawmakers from both the garden state and the empire state  these cuts would have limited access to critical services for people living with hiv and aids  such as primary health care  support services  and medication assistance programs  the four senators placed a hold on the reauthorization bill  using a parliamentary privilege afforded to u s  senators that prevented the bill  s consideration by the full senate  their holds were released today           over the past year  i have been working with my colleagues to reauthorize this important piece of legislation and have been forced time and time again to oppose reauthorization proposals because of their devastating impact on new york  the epicenter of the hiv aids epidemic   i am proud that we have forged a three year compromise that contains essential protections for new york and other hard hit states   we have come a long way from the original proposals to decimate and devastate our systems of care in new york and other parts of the country   however  much work needs to be done going forward   this bill alone cannot make up for years of flat funding for programs that provide essential care and support services across the nation   i look forward to working with my colleagues over the coming years to improve the ability of this act to meet the needs of all people living with hiv and aids     said senator clinton           every man  woman and child living with hiv aids deserves the best treatment we can give them  and that  s what our fight over the distribution of funding has been about   instead of leaving those new jerseyans without the care and resources they need  we  ve restored millions in proposed funding cuts     senator lautenberg said     i look forward to working closely with senator kennedy to make further improvements to the ryan white law in january              while this final bill is not everything we would have liked to achieve  it is a far cry from where the original proposals began     senator menendez said    this compromise bill preserves new jersey  s eligible metropolitan areas  sets a funding floor for formula grants and holds the bush administration accountable for how supplemental ema funds are spent  moreover  new jersey lawmakers have elicited commitments from senator ted kennedy that our state will have a seat at the table in ensuring our state  s interests moving forward              we are happy to reach a compromise that staves off millions of dollars in cuts  but realize that work remains to be done     said senator schumer     we need to continue to fight for additional money for the ryan white care act so the funding corresponds to need  and so that new yorkers living with hiv aids receive the care and services they deserve   we also need to re visit the entire structure of the care act to better serve the needs of people living with hiv aids in the future             first enacted by congress in 1990  the ryan white care act was amended and reauthorized in 1996 and again in 2000  the bill reaches over 500 000 individuals each year  making it the federal government s largest program specifically for people living with hiv and aids  the care act was named for ryan white  an indiana teenager whose courageous struggle with hiv aids and against aids related discrimination helped educate the nation',\n",

two thousand u s  soldiers killed in iraq         mr  president  there is a dark cloud hanging over our nation  that cloud emanates from iraq  and has rained countless tears on american families from across our nation who have lost loved ones       and now  we have received somber news about how many american troops have sacrificed their lives for our nation  there are 2 000 dead  two thousand       it is a grim milestone  and in addition to the two thousand dead  more than 15 000 have been seriously wounded       these are more than numbers  every casualty is a life cut short or torn apart       mr  president  outside my office across the street in the hart building  i have set up a memorial to these fallen heroes  when you look at those faces    the young lives cut short    it breaks your heart        when i started the senate memorial  i hoped that major combat would soon be over and that our casualties would be minimal        but major combat has dragged on      and the memorial display has unfortunately grown and grown       it has gotten to the point that the memorial takes up most of the space on the landing outside my office        there is a similar memorial set up in the longworth house office building by representatives rahm emmanuel and walter jones        i encourage all of my colleagues to visit these memorials and pay tribute to our troops       as we reach this grim milestone today  it is critical that we examine the situation we are facing in iraq       the president made a speech today  he basically said   let s keep doing what we have been doing   we also heard the usual rhetoric about  spreading freedom         but do we need more slogans       i remember the president s slogan on the aircraft carrier   mission accomplished   the president declared  major combat operations  to be over       but since the president declared  mission accomplished  in may 2003 we have lost 1 855 troops        as the debacle on the aircraft carrier proved  slogans are only as good as the banner they are written on       but  mr  president  we don t need more slogans  we need a plan       a plan that will provide relief to our troops so they aren t shouldering all of the burden in iraq       the president and his team ignored the wise advice of the state department and alienated our usual allies before the war with incredible arrogance and ineptitude       last year  the president scolded my colleague senator kerry while debating this issue  alleging that he  forgot poland   but even poland is pulling out of iraq now       with the exception of british troops in basra  we are essentially going it alone across the rest of iraq       and as our troops go it alone  they have to live with president bush s taunt to our enemies   bring  em on   i ask the president  have they sufficiently brought them on       what the troops on the ground need is less cowboy talk and more of a plan that defines our specific goals       they would like to know exactly how many iraqi troops need to be trained before our soldiers can begin to come home  but all we hear from president bush over and over again is that we need to  complete the mission   but then we are not told what the mission is       mr  president  today i hope every american will pause and reflect on the price that has been paid by our brave soldiers       their bravery is above question    but the administration s policy in iraq is not        the american people have a right and even a duty to demand answers from our government       our troops deserve nothing less       every flag draped coffin represents a family that will never again share a moment with their beloved spouse  child or sibling  it was very telling early on in this conflict when the administration banned the photography of flag draped coffins landing back on our shores from iraq       why ban these tributes to heroes that sacrificed their lives for our country  the administration argued about an invasion of privacy        but that is a red herring    of course the funerals themselves are private  but at issue was the return of these caskets to dover air force base       both presidents reagan and clinton publicly met flag draped coffins on the tarmac at dover  but under this president  we cannot even take photographs       we should honor    not hide    flag draped coffins  they are a symbol of the respect  honor and dignity that our fallen heroes deserve        and we honor today the 2 000 heroes who sacrificed their lives for our country        i urge the president to pay tribute to their memory by offering a realistic  concise plan that will allow us to finally transfer power to iraqis and bring our troops home',\n",

american taxpayers by tobacco companies from  130 billion to  10 billion  united states senators frank  r  lautenberg  d nj   edward m  kennedy  d ma   richard durbin  d il  and ron wyden  d or  used a capitol hill news conference to blast the decision by the administration  lautenberg and the other lawmakers sent a letter to the inspector general at the justice department demanding an immediate investigation  senators tom harkin  d ia  and bill nelson  d fl  also signed on to the letter         this reeks of political interference by the bush administration   said lautenberg   big tobacco is one of the top donors to republicans  and it is getting what it paid for  when faced with a choice between protecting a generation of american children or a rogue industry  the bush administration chose the industry        lautenberg is the author of the 1987 law banning smoking on airline flights  he is also the author of the 1994 law requiring all buildings housing federally funded children s programs to be smoke free  this includes all public schools  federally funded day care centers and wic programs  senator lautenberg also introduced one of the first bills in congress to make the tobacco companies pay for the medicare and medicaid costs associated with tobacco use        the clinton administration rose above politics and initiated this critical lawsuit to compensate taxpayers for the cost of the tobacco industry s misdeeds   said lautenberg   now the bush administration is caving to the influence of big tobacco s political power        the text of the letter is attached to this release       june 8  2005      the honorable glenn a  fine inspector general u s  department of justice office of the inspector general 950 pennsylvania avenue  nw  suite 4322 washington  d c  20530 0001      dear mr  fine       we are writing because of our deep concern over recent events in the government s landmark case against the major tobacco companies  united states v  philip morris usa inc  et al  like all of those who have closely followed the case  we were shocked by the position that the justice department took in court yesterday on the crucial issue of damages  the government had presented extensive expert testimony that  130 billion would be needed to finance a comprehensive national smoking cessation program to counteract the harm caused by the defendants  highly addictive product  rather than base its claim for damages on the evidence presented by its own expert  the justice department inexplicably asked the court to order the companies to pay only  10 billion  less than eight percent of the amount the government is entitled to recover based on the trial record  this action appears to seriously compromise the government s position in the case  undermining our ability to obtain a strong and effective remedy for the egregious misconduct of the defendants       what is particularly disturbing are news reports that the career justice department attorneys who have pursued the case against the tobacco industry for more than six years wanted to seek the full  130 billion to fund smoking cessation programs  but were overruled by high ranking political appointees        according to today s washington post        sources and government officials close to the case said the trial lawyers wanted to request  130 billion for smoking cessation programs  but were pressured by leaders in the attorney general s office  particularly  associate attorney general robert d   mccallum  to make the cut        the los angeles times made a similar report        a person familiar with the situation  speaking on a condition of anonymity  said the change was  forced on the tobacco team by higher level  politically appointed officials of the justice department   including associate atty  gen  robert mccallum  who oversees the civil division   there should be a thorough investigation to determine whether there was in fact political interference in the prosecution of this case       no credible explanation has been offered to explain the department s sudden abandonment of the evidence based remedy which had been established through lengthy  detailed expert testimony  the legitimacy of the  10 billion claim for damages made by the department yesterday is called into question by the very testimony that the government painstakingly presented over the last year       in light of these disturbing facts  we request the office of the inspector general to investigate the manner in which the decision to reduce the claim for damages from  130 billion to  10 billion was made  and to determine whether improper interference by political appointees led to a reversal of the position advocated by the career professionals

today announced the support of members of the bi partisan coalition of mayors against illegal guns for legislation that will keep guns out of the hands of terrorists    the bill  s  1237   h r  2074  was introduced by sen  lautenberg and rep  peter king  r ny  and  for the first time  allows the department of justice to prohibit known and suspected terrorists from buying a gun  currently  terror suspects are not prohibited from purchasing firearms  this bill gives the justice department the authority to block such purchases    it defies common sense that nothing in our gun laws prevents terror suspects from buying a firearm this  terror gap  in our gun laws has been open too long and my bill will close that gap  said sen  lautenberg  d nj    one of the most glaring mistakes in preventing 9 11 was the governments failure to share information and connect the dots  said mayor bloomberg  as you remember  2 of the 19 hijackers were on a terrorist watch list  yet they were allowed to board an airplane  today  suspected terrorists cannot fly  but they can still buy guns we just cant afford to wait for another attack to take these kinds of basic  common sense precautions   i cant think of a more obvious disqualifying criterion from purchasing a weapon than being listed on a terror watch list  said rep  king  the ranking member on the house homeland security committee  it is unfathomable to me that we knowingly allow the transfer of firearms to these individuals  changing this policy should be a no brainer  our role in congress is to create laws that protect the american people  not to uphold those that give terrorists the right to bear arms   the senator and the mayor were joined by trenton  new jersey mayor and president of the us conference of mayors douglas h  palmer  jersey city mayor jerremiah healy  new york city police commissioner raymond w  kelly and devorah halberstam  the mother of ari halberstam  who was killed by a terrorist wielding an illegal gun on a brooklyn bridge on ramp near the site of todays event   the lautenberg king bill would close the terror gap that allows terrorists to buy guns  currently  there are nine factors  such as status as a felon or evidence of serious mental health problems  under federal law that disqualify an individual from buying a gun  but being a known or suspected terrorist is not one of those factors the government is powerless to stop a gun sale to a terror suspect unless he also meets one of the nine disqualifying factors the lautenberg   king bill gives the department of justice the ability to use terror watch lists to prevent a terror suspect from purchasing a firearm from a licensed dealer  the bill also allows the department of justice to prevent known and suspected terrorists from working with explosives and from becoming a federal firearms license  ffl  holder these doj determinations would be subject to judicial review and  under the bill  a suspect would have the opportunity to challenge the determination in federal court   following a request by sen  lautenberg  the government accountability office  gao  found in 2005 that individuals on terrorist watch lists were able to purchase guns at gun stores in the u s  the legislation introduced by sen  lautenberg and rep  king is modeled on a bill drafted by the department of justice in response to the gao report  since the lautenberg   king bill has been introduced  the department of justice has announced its support for it   terrorists have repeatedly attempted to purchase firearms and some terrorists have already attacked americans using firearms   individuals on various terrorist watch lists have bought guns legally in the past  according to the fbi and the government accountability office  individuals on various terrorist watch lists were able to buy guns from licensed dealers 47 times during a nine month span in 2004 in the new york area alone  terrorists have repeatedly taken lives in attacks using guns   on november 5  1990 in a manhattan hotel  el sayed a  nosair assassinated rabbi meir kahane with a  357 revolver with a defaced serial number nosair was linked to the perpetrators

white house official identified as  official a  disclosed the identity of an undercover cia agent to columnist robert novak  who published the information  white house officials have confirmed that

violation of these standards becomes evident  you are required to take  prompt action to investigate alleged violations of security  and recommen d  appropriate administrative action with respect to violators         the actions described in the indictment led to the publication of the name of a cia operative whose employment status was classified  this revelation of classified information damaged national security by destroying an operative s covert cover  compromising intelligence gathering operations  and endangering the safety of other cia employees and their contacts        in addition to mr  rove  the indictment raises concerns about whether other current and former white house officials mishandled classified information  among the persons that appear to be referenced  by

                                         monday  january 30  2006      mr  president  i rise to discuss the president s nomination of samuel a  alito  jr  to the supreme court of the united states       it s no secret that judge alito is from my home state and i was honored to introduce him to the judiciary committee  i talked with him privately in my office  he is an accomplished jurist from a distinguished family in my state        at the hearing  our colleague from pennsylvania  chairman specter  asked me if i was endorsing judge alito for this position       i told him that i am just presenting evidence to the committee  and i will let the record speak for itself       i wasn t going to make any prejudgments  i wanted to hear from judge alito  i wanted to listen to his answers to my colleagues  questions       mr  president  this nomination    as all are when it comes to the supreme court    is an incredibly important moment for our nation  particularly because judge alito has been nominated to replace justice sandra day o connor       justice o connor  over the past 25 years  has proven that she is not a ideologically conservative justice or a liberal justice  she has not brought an agenda to the court       that is why justice o connor has been a swing vote    because she always studied the facts and the law and tried to apply them fairly  i didn t always agree with her  but like many americans  i knew she came at these legal questions fairly and with an open mind       she showed respect for precedent  she put the law above her personal beliefs  in my view  it is critical that we replace justice o connor with someone who shares her open minded approach of looking at the law and the facts  with no political agenda  even the mere threat of legal activism on this supreme court threatens the future of this country  and the rights of our children  our grandchildren and other future generations       many legal experts     judges  lawyers  and professors have contacted me regarding this nomination  some supported him  some opposed him  many of these experts tried to convince me one way or the other        but when i listened to judge alito s hearings in the judiciary committee  i listened with the faces of my grandchildren in my mind  and with thoughts of ordinary people who depend on the fairness of our society        i was applying judge alito s philosophy to the real problems everyday people    in new jersey and across the nation    face       i often hear many concerns from my constituents about how powerless they feel in the face of insurance companies that are often indifferent to their plight or as an employee unfairly treated in the workplace       what rights do everyday americans have in the face of giant corporations or unchecked government power       at the hearings  it was clear that judge alito almost always lined up against the  little guy  and with the big corporations and government       in fact  a knight ridder study of judge alito s rulings showed that he  seldom sided with     an employee alleging discrimination or consumers suing big business         a washington post analysis of all divided opinions on the third circuit involving judge alito found that he  has sided against three of every four people who claimed to have been victims of discrimination  and  routinely    defers to government officials and others in position of authority         let me cite two examples        in bray v  marriott  an african american hotel worker in park ridge  new jersey alleged discrimination against her employer  the third circuit ruled that she deserved her day in court because there was enough evidence of discrimination  but judge alito dissented  citing concerns about the cost of trials to employers  the other judges in the case criticized judge alito s dissent  saying that if it were the law  then the employment discrimination laws would have no real effect       in another case  sheridan v  dupont  judge alito was the only judge of eleven judges who heard the case to find against a woman s claim of gender discrimination  judge alito stated that the alleged victim shouldn t even get a trial  the other judges were so distressed by judge alito s decision that they said    quote     the judicial system has little to gain by judge alito s approach        so if he is confirmed to the supreme court  will judge alito make it more difficult for everyday people to protect themselves and their families against the power of big business and unchecked government  unfortunately  it appears almost certain       regarding individual rights  there was a very disturbing exchange in the hearing involving the constitutional right to reproductive choice        senator durbin asked judge alito if he would agree with chief justice roberts  statement that the right to choose is  settled law   it seems to me that it was a  no brainer     of course it is settled law  it has been on the books for 33 years and upheld 38 times  you don t have to go to law school to figure that one out       but judge alito refused to say it was  settled law   to me it was a telling moment in the hearings       mr  president  i am not a lawyer  but i understand this  the right to choose is settled law        judge alito s refusal to acknowledge that the right to choose is settled law  indicates to me that  even before he sits on the supreme court  he intends to overturn roe v  wade       for everyday new jerseyans  especially our state s women  that would be the realization of a nightmare  we do not want to turn back the clock on women s rights  even if abortions become illegal  they will still happen    but largely in unsafe conditions  it s a nightmare that i do not want to risk happening       then there is the issue of abuse of power and the power of the presidency       growing up in new jersey  it is clear that our state is proud of our role in the american war for independence  more battles of the revolutionary war were fought in new jersey than in any other state  the most famous image of that war is george washington crossing the delaware river at trenton       new jersey is a state of immigrants  many new jerseyans came to america to escape kings  despots and dictators  so we understand why we fought the war of independence to get rid of king george       america doesn t want a king or an  imperial president   neither does new jersey  that s why we have three co equal branches of government       so when judge alito talked about his theory of a  unitary executive     a president above the other two branches of government    i found that very troubling       the father of our nation  george washington  warned the american people about allowing a leader to claim too much power  in his farewell address to the nation  washington indicated his concern about the presidency becoming too powerful        he said we should avoid allowing    quote        t he exercise of the powers of one department to encroach upon another  the spirit of encroachment tends to consolidate the powers of all the departments in one  and thus to create  whatever the form of government  a real despotism       those are washington s words  but they have a real resonance today        the current administration claims a power beyond the laws that congress has set  it is an administration that believes it can spy on americans without a warrant  despite specific laws to the contrary  these are the kinds of abuses that caused the citizens of new jersey and the other american colonies to rise up against king george       mr  president  we don t want a king  and we don t want to create a supreme court that will crown this president    or any future president    republican or democratic        the question before us is not a generic question of whether judge alito is qualified for the supreme court  the real question is whether judge alito is the right person for this seat on the supreme court  the seat at issue is sandra day o connor s seat  it is a seat held by a middle of the road  balanced justice       as i noted during my testimony introducing judge alito to the judiciary committee  he is a young man  if the senate confirms him for a lifetime appointment to the supreme court  he might serve for three decades    or even longer  his decisions would affect not only our rights  but also the rights of our children  our grandchildren and other future generations        that s why  after careful consideration and deliberation  i have decided to vote no on the confirmation of judge alito  he is a good  decent man    an ethical man  i do not think he subscribes to any bigoted views  but i believe there is a grave risk that he carries a legal agenda with him  one that he will bring to the supreme court       while there will be law professors and others who will disagree with my analysis  as i said before  i am more concerned about the effect of this nomination on everyday people in new jersey and across the nation       i am proud there is a federal courthouse in newark named after me  i asked that an inscription be placed on the walls of that courthouse  it reads   the true measure of a democracy is its dispensation of justice         i believe in that quote  it guides me today        so for the parents fighting an insurance company

reconsideration of major base closings that will cost far more than what was estimated during the pentagons base realignment and closure  brac  process  sens  robert menendez  d nj  and frank lautenberg  d nj  are keenly aware of some of the wildly inaccurate cost estimates used in the brac process  since the closing of new jerseys fort monmouth is now expected to cost almost twice its original  780 million price tag   the point of this process was to reduce costs  but now the price tag for some of these base closings is ballooning out of control and taxpayers are the ones carrying the burden  said menendez  if taxpayers are being forced to foot an enormous bill they werent expecting  there should be an escape hatch  in new jersey  we have communities and families that will be greatly impacted by the closing of fort monmouth  knowing that the decision was based on miscalculations and misinformation does not sit well with our state  and it should not sit well with taxpayers across the country either   this bill would require real accountability and transparency in the base closure process  it would ensure that excessive cost overruns in closing a base like fort monmouth never happen again  it would also provide a method to review the closure of fort monmouth so that we can reevaluate the decision to close the base that was based upon faulty information  i look forward to working to get this legislation enacted into law  said sen  lautenberg   menendez lautenberg brac cost overruns protection act of 2007  brac cop act of 2007   summary  the point of the brac process is to reduce costs  but the cost of brac has ballooned out of control  from the brac commissions original  one time implementation cost estimate of  21 billion to a current price tag of  30 billion  a 43  increase  the menendez legislation simply tries to control these excessive costs and ensure that brac is maximizing our tax payers money  the legislation works from a basic principle  already in existing law  that we need to take another look if the costs have increased by more than 25 percent   details   the legislation is based on principles found in existing law concerning cost overruns in weapons programs  known as the nunn mccurdy amendment   the nunn mccurdy amendment was included in the fiscal year 1982 defense authorization act       the menendez legislation will create a trigger mechanism to require a re evaluation of any major base realignment or closure should the actual cost exceed bracs estimated cost by more than 25 percent     how the trigger mechanism is designed    1  the secretary of defense will write biannual reports on the cost of implementing the pending base closure or realignment recommendations mandated by brac law     2  if the secretary determines that the actual cost of implementing a major base closure or realignment recommendation has exceeded the original cost estimate   which was the basis for the law passed by congress   by more than 25 percent  the secretary shall   a   notify the chairman and ranking member of congressional defense committees  b   devise a business plan to reduce the cost of the base closure or  realignment  without re adjusting the baseline estimated cost  so that it does not exceed a 25 percent increase   3  within 45 days  the secretary of defense will submit a recommendation to the president on whether to continue the base closure or realignment     4  within 30 days of receiving the secretarys recommendation  the president will make a recommendation to congress on whether to continue the base closure or realignment     5  congress has the option to vote to disapprove the presidents recommendation     if the secretary of defense recommends that the president continue or modify the base closure or realignment  despite the excessive cost overruns  the secretary must include in his recommendation to the president an explanation of why it is necessary to continue implementing the recommendation   the term major base closure and realignment shall include any base cloture and or realignment that requires  150 million or more in military construction costs and an

to reconsider the decision  a copy of the letter follows     for years  the shark river coast guard station has been open year round  providing critical safety resources for a thriving boating and fishing community this summer  the coast guard announced plans to close the station from october until the week before memorial day    in their letter to admiral allen  lautenberg and pallone voiced concern over the proposal since the winter months present riskier conditions for boaters on the atlantic ocean last year  13 of the 33 search and rescue cases handled by the station occurred during

and we ask you to reconsider    lautenberg and pallone also vowed today to explore legislative solutions in the coming months if the coast guard refuses to reconsider its decision   shark river is an important facility for new jersey s boating and fishing community  said lautenberg  boaters using this port need to know that the coast guard will be able to provide critical assistance in case of an emergency  as we ve done with similar threats of closure in the past  we will work to keep the station open and keep our boaters safe    i m hopeful that the coast guard was convinced by august s public forum that closing the shark river station would unnecessarily put a lot of boaters and fishermen at risk  pallone said if the coast guard ignores our concerns  senator lautenberg and i will work through the legislative process to keep this station open at all times    the letter comes after the two new jersey lawmakers learned of the proposal earlier this summer in august  at the urging of pallone  the coast guard held a public forum to present the plan and to hear the opinions of concerned citizens nearly everyone in attendance  from boaters to fishermen  voiced strong opposition to the plan    ten years ago  the coast guard proposed a similar plan that would have closed the shark river coast guard station on november 15th for the winter season lautenberg and pallone were successful in fighting that proposal and for the past decade the station has been staffed with search and rescue support 24 hours a day  seven days a week  365 days a year   october 23  2007  admiral thad w  allen commandant  u s  coast guard  2100 second street  sw  washington  dc 20593  dear admiral allen   we read with great interest a story in last sundays washington post magazine in which you were interviewed about your early career experiences with the coast guards search and rescue program we found your recollection about the rescue of mariners off the jersey shore in blizzard conditions remarkable  and are thankful every day for your dedication and that of the other men and women of the u s  coast guard   however  we are horrified to learn that the coast guard plans to reduce operations and response capabilities this year on the jersey shore at the coast guard station in shark river inlet  nj this stationwhich we understand you intend to close from october to may  would deprive this area of critical safety resources for a thriving boating community   fishermen  both commercial and recreational  fish throughout the year off the jersey shore  not just during the summer months in 2006  13 of the 33 search and rescue cases handled at the shark river coast guard station occurred during the off season or non summer months if station shark river were closed when these cases occurred  response boats would have to travel an additional 6 miles from station manasquan which would result in longer response times this could mean life or death for boaters in peril   you probably know as well as anyone that in the winter months  the atlantic ocean presents riskier conditions for boaters under these dangerous conditions  it is vital to have sufficient coast guard search and rescue capabilities   furthermore  among their many important duties  station shark river personnel monitor boating safety  including incidents of boating under the influence and proper compliance with boat equipment regulations with the large number of recreational fishermen and recreational boaters on the jersey shore  this aspect of the coast guard s mission is vital to maritime safety in the region   based on your interview  it does not appear that during your early years of service you viewed search and rescue calls simply as casesrather  on the other end of those calls were peopleboaters in distress  whose lives may be in serious danger we hope your first hand experience on the jersey shore will remind you that time is of the essence in these situations   we believe that under the coast guards plan  boaters in the shark river inlet area will be put at greater risk of not having the coast guard respond in time to prevent the loss of lives we oppose this plan  and

anticipate approval by the assistant secretary of the army  civil works   john paul woodley  jr  of these funds and we urge a speedy confirmation by omb  these funds will allow for the continued

reprogrammed from the oakland project for other priority national needs with the expectation that these funds would be restored to the project in the future  completing the existing contract on the pompton lakes dam in fy06 will require an estimated  3 8 million  but only  1 3 million was provided to the ramapo river at oakland flood control project in the 2006 energy and water development

residents of pompton lakes  wayne  and oakland  new jersey  most recently  remnants of tropical storm tammy  hurricane wilma  and other intermittent systems caused continual precipitation that saturated the ramapo river basin for most of october 2005  these events received national media coverage and highlighted the urgent need to complete the construction to provide much needed flood

said a new general accountability office  gao  report shows how the bush administration has worked to undermine the public right to know law that informs people about the release of toxic chemicals in their communities  sens  lautenberg and boxer said the gao report demonstrates the need for congress to approve legislation to overturn the environmental protection agencys  epa  rules weakening toxic reporting requirements that had been in place for nearly two decades   people who live near chemical facilities have a right to know about the potential poisons released into their air and water  unfortunately  this report makes clear the bush administration is putting politics ahead of science and letting facilities hide critical data about toxic chemicals  this disturbing report shows the administration pushed to weaken the publics right to know about the release of dozens of toxic chemicals from thousands of facilities nationwide  it is time to overturn this rule and restore the publics right to know about the release of toxic chemicals in their communities  said sen  frank r  lautenberg  who authored the legislation that created the 1986 right to know program    senator boxer said  the public has a right to know about toxic pollution in local communities  the bush administrations epa has rolled back that right for special interests at the publics expense  gaos report confirms the serious flaws in epas process and emboldens me to press ahead to restore the publics right to know and move forward on senator lautenbergs legislation    at the request of sens  lautenberg  boxer and olympia snowe  r me   the gao prepared a written report on the epas december 2006 rulemaking under the toxics release inventory  tri  program  tri is the preeminent federal public right to know program for toxic chemicals  health officials  federal  state and local governments  business  and the public use tri to reduce chemical threats to public health    the gao concluded that     the rule could significantly reduce environmental information on dozens of toxic chemicals released from thousands of facilities across the country    epas rule would allow more than 3 500 facilities to no longer report detailed information about their toxic chemical releases and waste management practices   epa did not follow key steps in agency guidelines designed to ensure that it conducts appropriate scientific  economic  and policy analysis    s enior epa management directed inclusion of a burden reduction optionin response to direction from omb and issued the rule to meet a burden reduction commitment to omb   epas burden reduction estimates used outdated data and are likely  25   overstated   epa issued the rule despite over 100 000 commentsthe vast majority expressed opposition to epas proposed changes  whereas about 30 commenters expressed support    the right to know law creating tri was authored by sen  lautenberg and passed into law in 1986 as part of the emergency planning and community right to know act  the law came in the wake of the tragic disaster at a union carbide facility in bhopal  india  which killed thousands of people  congress passed the law to ensure that communities know how much of a variety of dangerous industrial chemicals are released into the air  water and the ground    in december 2006  the epa announced final rules that weakened reporting requirements for the tri  with these rules  the bush administration has undermined this critical program by eliminating detailed reports from thousands of facilities nationwide that release up to 2 000 pounds of chemicals every year and eliminating detailed reporting requirements for facilities that manage up to 500 pounds of chemicals known to pose some of the worst threats to human health  including lead and mercury    sen  lautenbergs new legislation  the toxic right to know protection act  reinstates the stronger reporting requirements that were in place

more new jersey and new york residents to commute by rail  and improve our environment  regional economy  and overall quality of life           lautenberg s letter outlined how the rail plan would reduce highway congestion on new jersey roadways and increase economic development throughout the metropolitan region           the tunnel can help alleviate traffic on our highways and roads by eliminating 35 000 vehicles every day  more trains means more jobs and further economic development  construction of the tunnel will create 6 000 new construction jobs each year and  when completed  44 000 permanent jobs  by building the tunnel  we will add  5 billion to new jersey s gross regional product and  2 billion in real personal income          last week  lautenberg announced that the tunnel received  16 million in federal funds  lautenberg has continually secured federal funding for the project since 1999   he has made the tunnel a top priority since his return to the appropriations committee         over the past 20 years  daily commuter rail trips between new jersey and new york city have doubled  but the demand is hitting a bottleneck in the current 100 year old  two track passenger tunnel under the hudson river             the proposed tunnel is part of a 5 mile rail line extension project from the frank r  lautenberg rail station at secaucus  nj  under the hudson river to the planned daniel patrick moynihan station in midtown manhattan   the existing tunnels are being used at capacity during peak hours  running 23 trains per hour   the existing tunnels also represent the biggest chokepoint on the northern new jersey rail network as well as the entire northeast rail corridor from boston  ma  to washington  dc              a copy of the lautenberg letter is attached         march 13  2007        tom schulze  nj transit arc project director  one penn plaza east  4th floor  newark  nj 07105        dear mr  schulz          i write in regard to the review of the draft environmental impact statement for the trans hudson express tunnel project   the tunnel     this project will have a major impact on the entire new jersey new york region   it will double commuter rail capacity under the hudson river  allow more new jersey and new york residents to commute by rail  and improve our environment  regional economy  and overall quality of life         as you know  the entire nj transit commuter rail network and amtrak s northeast corridor both narrow down into a 100 year old stretch of track that runs from the frank r  lautenberg station in secaucus   the track then runs under the hudson river and into penn station new york   we must expand that bottleneck if we want to have a 21st century rail system or if an emergency requires the evacuation of manhattan        we must also expand that bottleneck if we want to reduce highway congestion   the tunnel can help alleviate traffic on our highways and roads by eliminating 35 000 vehicles every day           more trains mean more jobs and further economic development   construction of the tunnel will create 6 000 new construction jobs each year and  when completed  44 000 permanent jobs   by building the tunnel  we will add  5 billion to new jersey s gross regional product and  2 billion in real personal income         we know that people want to travel by commuter rail as nj transit ridership at penn station new york has increased 400 percent in 25 years  to more than 40 million trips in 2006   ultimately  it will result in a better quality of life for tens of thousands of new jerseyans           we have to protect our economy  our environment and our regional attractiveness   i have fought hard for and helped fund many significant transportation projects over my 22 years serving new jersey in the senate  and have fought for federal funding for the tunnel since 1999   i look forward to working with my colleagues in washington to make sure this critical tunnel project gets built as soon as possible       sincerely        frank r  lautenberg',\n",

debate over when u s  forces should begin to come home from iraq      mr  president  i rise to speak in support of the resolution put forth by the senior senator from michigan  and i appreciate the fact that he has framed the debate on the war in iraq  both for the senate and for the american people       last week  the american military death toll in iraq passed 2 500   it was a tragic milestone   and the american people are not happy about it  because the president has not articulated what exactly we are trying to accomplish in iraq       i maintain a gallery of pictures of u s  servicepeople who have died in iraq and afghanistan outside the front door of my office  to remind me and all who visit my office of these american heroes       as a veteran  i find the current situation in iraq especially painful    because i know what those troops and their families are going through       i know the bush administration is saying that some iraqis are worried about us leaving   but i say this  the american people are worried about us staying      what more can we do for the iraqi people   we have spent 20 billion dollars of u s  taxpayer funds to rebuild their nation  s infrastucture  we have helped them hold three elections   we have trained and armed their police and military         i say  it  s time for them to take control of their own country       i have heard my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say that we would bring   dishonor    to those who lost their lives if we begin to leave iraq        but ask the families with loved ones over there how they feel   i met in my newark office with a group of families with loved ones in iraq        including a mother who lost her son   as far as they were concerned  it would bring dishonor to other families if we just stay there with no plan for the future        so why are we having so much trouble securing iraq   the answer is clear  the administration had no plan in place to do it   and when they tried  we saw mistep after mistep by the civilian leaders in the pentagon      and the leadership problems at the pentagon start at the top     mr  president  our troops on the ground have not been well served by the secretary of defense       some say   send the troops home           but i believe our first order of business should be to send secretary rumsfeld home       secretary rumsfeld has been denying reality since 2003   and he will not admit that the administration grossly miscalulated what would be needed to win the war       this administration went to war on the cheap      not enough troops   not enough body armor   not enough help from our allies   and our troops have paid the price for these mistakes       there were so many mistakes and miscalculations by the bush administration        it is staggering       secretary rumsfeld said that iraqis would welcome u s  troops  and that the iraqi resistance would be limited   that was obviously wrong       he also failed to build coalitions with our allies   one of the few major allies that did join the coalition was poland  which sent about 1 600 troops  but they began withdrawing early this year   half are gone already    and by the end of the year  poland will have all its troops out of iraq       and just this week  the japanese announced they will withdraw their troops  so far  sixteen nations who provided some assistance in iraq have withdrawn their troops         this administration  s failure to build a real coalition has caused our troops to bear the vast majority of risk and suffer the casualties       secretary rumsfeld said the war would be short    i doubt six months     he said   more than three years later  we know that assessment was tragically wrong        additionally  secretary rumsfeld was also way off on the cost of the war    he said it would cost no more than 100 billion dollars         but the current cost is a staggering 320 billion dollars        and now we are experiencing a crisis in military recruiting   but even about that  secretary rumsfeld is in denial       whether in public or in private  the secretary claims recruiting is fine   it  s not  here is the reality  the army national guard and reserve are falling well short of their goals   and the only reason other branches are meeting goals is because the pentagon has reduced the target numbers       mr  president  eight retired generals have come forward to say what many in the military have been thinking for years  it  s time for secretary rumsfeld to leave his post         one of the generals  general eaton  who served in iraq  said the following about secretary rumsfeld    quote          in sum  he has shown himself incompetent strategically  operationally and tactically  and is far more than anyone else responsible for what has happened to our important mission in iraq  mr  rumsfeld must step down          but instead of taking a stand like the generals  we have heard our colleagues on the other side of the aisle simply repeat talking points that were handed to them by the bush administration       we know this because the secretary of defense sent a republican briefing book to democrats by mistake last week       this briefing book is a three ring binder of spin   and it contains the same spin you are hearing from the other side of the chamber today       instead of developing talking points and spin for republican senators  secretary rumsfeld should concentrate on putting together a plan for our troops in iraq       we need a fresh start and honest leadership    and we are not going to get either one as long as secretary rumsfeld is in charge at the pentagon     secretary rumsfeld must go and it is time to start bringing our troops home      i

lautenberg and robert menendez  congressmen frank pallone and donald payne today called on the bush administration to extend the signup period for the new medicare prescription drug plan through the end of the year       during a meeting with senior citizens  the lawmakers announced that they had sent a letter to health and human services  hhs  secretary michael leavitt demanding that the administration lift the deadline  secretary leavitt was in new jersey at an event in somerset today where he defended the medicare deadline        this  medicare maze  of a drug plan is just too complicated to pressure people to make a quick decision   said senator lautenberg   new jersey seniors shouldn t be penalized because the medicare drug plan is so confusing  time is running out  and the administration needs to act now         the outcry i hear in new jersey and across the country hasn t changed   menendez said  seniors and their families need more time to figure out how the new program works and which drug plan is best for them  instead of penalizing our seniors for taking a little more time in choosing a plan  the bush administration should be providing them with more time to weigh through this complex program         secretary leavitt can march around the country all he wants touting the plan and the deadline  but he can t ignore the fact that seniors are receiving inaccurate or incomplete information 60 percent of the time they call the 1 800 medicare line   congressman pallone said   seniors are still rightfully confused  and the bush administration shouldn t even consider a deadline until it finally gets all its facts straight          because the program pushed through by the republican controlled congress is so complex  it is unreasonable to impose this arbitrary deadline  seniors need more time to examine the multitude of prescription drug plans to determine which will best suit their medical needs  the fact that so many have not signed up yet is a strong indication that the program is flawed   said congressman payne        about 360 000 new jerseyans who are eligible for a medicare drug plan have not yet enrolled  if they don t sign up before monday s deadline they would have to wait six months to join    and would then have to pay a penalty every month on top of the regular premiums for the drug coverage for the rest of their lives       the republican controlled congress has refused to pass legislation supported by lautenberg  menendez  pallone and payne to extend the deadline to december 31  2006    exactly one year after the new medicare prescription drug law went into effect       a copy of the letter to secretary leavitt is attached       may 12  2006      the honorable michael o  leavitt secretary of health and human services department of health and human services 200 independence avenue  s w  washington  dc 20201      dear secretary leavitt       we are writing to strongly urge you to extend the medicare part d enrollment deadline until the end of the year  unless this action is taken  any seniors seeking to enroll in a drug plan after monday will be forced to wait until november to sign up        at last count in new jersey  approximately 360 000 individuals who are eligible for medicare prescription drug coverage have not yet elected to join a specific plan  we are extremely concerned that these individuals will be denied the opportunity to enroll in a drug plan for the next six months and that if they choose to enroll at a later date they will incur a life time penalty        unfortunately  many seniors and individuals with disabilities have had difficulty in choosing a plan because they are confused about the new benefit  medicare beneficiaries face an overwhelming number of prescription drug plan options  and choosing the right plan can be a challenge  in new jersey there are 19 providers offering 45 prescription drug plans  the monthly premiums  deductibles  co payments and formulary for each of these plans differs making the process of selecting a plan difficult and time consuming        while we are disappointed that the republican leadership in congress refused to support an extension of this deadline  their refusal does not stop the administration from taking unilateral action       just last month  the centers for medicare and medicaid services  cms  announced that the agency would allow some low income medicare beneficiaries additional time to enroll in the prescription drug benefit without financial penalty  we believe the same legal authority used to extend the deadline and waive the penalty for low income seniors can be applied in this case        we respectfully urge you to announce your intention to delay both the enrollment deadline and penalty as soon as possible  we want to prevent our constituents from making rushed health care choices that may harm them in the future       thank you for your attention to this important matter        sincerely       frank r  lautenberg robert menendez      frank pallone  jr  donald m  payne',\n",

controlincluding over the counter emergency contraceptionwas introduced by senator frank lautenberg  d nj  and u s  representative carolyn b  maloney  ny 14  today    the access to birth control  abc  act  would make it illegal for a pharmacy to refuse to fill birth control prescriptions and require pharmacies to help  not hinder a woman s ability to access contraception   no woman should be denied the medicine she needs to stay healthy  lautenberg said  this bill is about basic health care for women in the 21st century  care that shouldn t be withheld by pharmacists with an agenda  passing this legislation would ensure that women get the care they need and the care that their doctors determine is necessary    an american woman can decide to put her life on the line for our country in iraq  but she can be prevented from making basic decisions about her own health here at home  said maloney  access to birth control is a women s health issue  a private matter and a constitutional right  no one   not pharmacists  politicians  or religious leaders   should be able to tamper with that right   i m pleased to join senator lautenberg in introducing this legislation that protects a woman s right to access medication that has been found by the fda to be medically safe and effective  the fda s long overdue decision on plan b last year was a victory for women s health  however  access to birth control and emergency contraception remains a challenge for women across this country  i will work with my colleagues in the senate and the house of representatives to support this legislation so that ideology remains separate from science in america  said clinton  an original co sponsor of the senate bill   the access to birth control  abc  act  would make it illegal for a pharmacy to refuse to fill birth control prescriptions and require pharmacies to help  not hinder a woman s ability to access contraception   ninety eight percent of american women use birth control at some point in their lives  yet reports of pharmacists denying women their birth control   both prescription and over the counter   have been well documented  it s happening to married women and to single women  to women with children and to women without  some pharmacists have refused to transfer birth control prescriptions to another more accommodating pharmacy  others have even refused to give the prescription slip back to the customer    leading women s groups have endorsed the abc bill  including naral pro choice america  planned parenthood  and the national women s law center  ninety eight percent of women will use contraception during their lifetimes  it s wrong for pharmacies to allow their employees to block customers  access to birth control  birth control is basic health care  said nancy keenan  president of naral pro choice america  we need action in congress because there is a coordinated effort in this country to block women s access to contraception  just this year 18 state legislatures considered measures that would allow pharmacies or pharmacists to refuse to fill women s birth control prescriptions  americans are tired of these divisive attacks on women s health and privacy  they want their elected officials to focus on improving women s access to birth control since it s the most commonsense way to prevent unintended pregnancies  that s why we applaud reps  maloney  shays and other cosponsors of the access to birth control act for standing up to protect  not block  women s access to birth control    birth control and emergency contraception are basic health care for women  it is 2007    any woman should be able to walk into any pharmacy  anywhere in the country  and get birth control or emergency contraception without discrimination or delay  said cecile richards  president of planned parenthood federation of america  congress should pass the access to birth control act to ensure that any woman who needs birth control or emergency contraception is able to get it    a woman s likelihood of becoming pregnant increases the longer she waits to take emergency contraception  and even one missed or late birth control pill can put a woman at an increased risk of an unwanted pregnancy   women who live in rural areas are at an even greater disadvantage when they re denied contraception because they may not have another pharmacy near them to go to  and low income women may not have transportation  or the additional time or money needed to track down a cooperative pharmacy   with this bill  every woman who goes to a pharmacy for contraception will leave with her medication in hand and her dignity in tact  said judy waxman  vice president for health and reproductive rights  national women s law center  the access to birth control act is an important step toward making sure all women have access to the contraceptives they need and depend on   in addition to guaranteeing women the ability to fill birth control prescriptions  the abc bill would make it illegal for a pharmacy to refuse to return a birth control prescription  or for a pharmacist to intimidate  threaten  or harass customers  or intentionally breach  or threaten to breach
